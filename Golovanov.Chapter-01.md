INTRODUCTION

The development of computers makes it possible to create numerical models of various objects and to perform experiments with them. Numerical models are used in systems that are used for design (CAD), engineering (CAE), and manufacturing (CAM) of the modeled object. In all these systems it is necessary to describe the geometric shape of the modeled object up to certain precision. During the development of these systems (a new branch of mathematics) called "geometric modeling" was created. Geometric modeling studies the methods used to construct numerical geometric models of real and imaginary objects, as well as methods to control these models.

A geometric model consists of a shape description for the modeled object along with a description of the relationships among the model elements. To allow changes of these models and creation of similar models, the construction tree describing the sequence and methods used in model construction is frequently included with the model. The elements of a geometric model are usually provided by attributes carrying information about their physical and other properties.

The development of geometric modeling began with computer drawing systems. Wireframe and surface modeling came later on. Parametric and solid modeling systems have dramatically changed the way designers work. They made it possible for designers to capture their ideas in three-dimensional models and not just in flat drawings. To describe the relationship of model elements, variational methods have been used. Another step in the development of geometric modeling was direct modeling, which further empowered engineers and designers by circumventing the constraints of history-based modelers.

The objects around us occupy a finite amount of space. In order to model these objects we need to describe the part of the space they occupy. In certain cases it can be done using the volume elements of the modeled object. These volume elements are called voxels. Often such volume elements are cubes, prisms, or pyramids. These models are used in the cases where the attributes of the volume elements are more important than the geometric shape of the whole model.

Within certain accuracy limitations, the geometric shape of an object can be described using flat faces. This kind of description is called polygonal representation. A polygonal representation describes curved surfaces using a set of triangular or quadrangular plates. Usage of flat faces significantly simplifies work with the model. Polygonal models are typically based on measurements of real objects, or on other models. Polygonal representation is widely used for visualization of geometric models.

Many objects can be constructed using translational and rotational motion. Surface elements of such objects can be specified by a plane, a spherical surface, a
cylindrical surface, a conical surface, or a toroidal surface. All of these surfaces divide the space into two parts, and one can specify on which side of the surface the internal volume of the modeled object is situated. With the help of these surfaces, it is possible to construct a geometric model by performing operations on primitives. The primitives usually include a rectangular prism, a triangular prism, a sphere, a cylinder, a cone, and a torus. This approach is called constructive solid geometry. Nowadays constructive solid geometry is rarely used.

The most general way to describe the geometric form of a modeled object is to use free-form surfaces, represented explicitly. In this approach, a surface representation of the modeled object is given by a set of faces joined along the edges. The faces contain information about their boundaries and relations to their neighbors. They are joined so that the outer side of one face merges into the outer side of the adjacent face. Faces may have an arbitrary form. This approach to describing a modeled object is called boundary representation. It makes it possible to perform many operations on models while maintaining a standard representation of their internal organization. A boundary representation contains a precise description of the boundary of the modeled object that separates it from the rest of the space. Boundary representation is used in all modern CAD systems.

Variational relations are established between the elements of a geometric model to align points, axes, and surfaces, as well as to specify tangency and many other relations. Interdependencies of model elements are called geometric constraints. Different dimensions of one or several objects may be related to each other. Using these relations one can easily edit the model and create similar models. Typically, there is more than one way to satisfy a set of geometric constraints. Most computer-aided design systems have modules that impose geometric constraints on the elements of the geometric model. Geometric modeling studies methods of finding a solution that meets the demands posed by an actual problem.

Geometric modeling relies on different areas of mathematics, primarily differential geometry and numerical methods. Geometric modeling is closely related to programming; it takes advantage of the features of object-orientation: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. For example, object-oriented programming allows creation of curves and surfaces that have some set of common methods, hiding the implementation of these methods for each particular curve and surface as well as data used to create them.

The geometric model is used in rendering the modeled object, checking the correct assemblage of the object from its elements, performing kinematic verification, calculating inertial characteristics, computing the trajectory of cutting tools, designing equipment, and other preliminary stages of modeled object production. Geometric models can help carry out numerical experiments and manufacture the modeled object. Attributes of the model elements describing physical and other properties of the modeled object are used for this purpose.

Geometric modeling can reduce the time and material costs for production of designed objects and improve their quality. Geometric modeling automates the work of designers, engineers, architects, and technologists, enabling them to avoid routine operations and concentrate on the creative aspects of their work.
CURVES

A geometric model contains a description of a shape of a modeled object. A geometric shape is described by surfaces. Curves are used for constructing the surfaces. Geometric design begins with curves. Geometric modeling uses curves that are easy to manipulate. Curves are controlled by changing the data used to construct them. The curves may be constructed using analytic functions, a set of points, or other curves and surfaces.

1.1. Curves

Suppose we have a Cartesian coordinate system with a fixed orthonormal basis in three-dimensional Euclidean space. A column of point coordinates and vector components will be denoted by lowercase letters, in boldâ€”for example,

$$ \mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 \\ p_2 \\ p_3 \end{bmatrix}. $$

A transformation that converts the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system to a point in space with specified coordinates is called a radius vector. The position of a point in space will be described by its radius vector.

The scalar product of vectors \( \mathbf{a} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) will be denoted as \( \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} \). The vector product of \( \mathbf{a} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) will be denoted as \( \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} \).

A curve is a vector function

$$ \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} r_1(t) \\ r_2(t) \\ r_3(t) \end{bmatrix} $$ (1.1.1)

of the scalar parameter \( t \), taking values in the interval \([t_{\text{min}}, t_{\text{max}}]\). Let the coordinates \( r_1(t), r_2(t), r_3(t) \) of the curve's point \( \mathbf{r}(t) \) be single-valued continuous functions of the parameter \( t \). This is called a parametric description of the curve.

A point of the curve is called regular if the length of the first derivative with respect to the parameter does not become zero at this point. Otherwise, the point is called singular.

A curve is called periodic if there exists \( p > 0 \), such that \( \mathbf{r}(t + kp) = \mathbf{r}(t) \), where \( k \)
is an integer. To avoid an ambiguity, the domain of periodic curve must lie within one period. A periodic curve is called a cyclic closed curve, if \( p = t_{\text{max}} - t_{\text{min}} \).

The parameter domain of the curve is a segment \([t_{\text{min}}, t_{\text{max}}]\) in one-dimensional space. The curve is a continuous mapping of the segment of the numerical axis onto three-dimensional space.

Here we introduce the notation for derivatives of the curve:

$$
r' = \frac{dr}{dt}, \quad r'' = \frac{d^2r}{dt^2}, \quad r''' = \frac{d^3r}{dt^3}.
$$

At a regular point, the derivative of the curve is a vector directed along the tangent to the curve in the direction in which the parameter increases. The unit vector

$$
t = \frac{r'}{s'}, \quad (1.1.2)
$$

where \( s' = \sqrt{r' \cdot r'} \) is the length of the first derivative of the curve, is called a tangent vector. The length of the first derivative depends on the parameterization method. If the arc length of the curve, measured from some of its points, is used as a parameter, then the length of the derivative is equal to unity. The vector function \( r(s) \), where \( s \) is arc length, is called a curve with natural parameterization.

Suppose we are given a curve with natural parameterization. Then the tangent vector is the first derivative of the curve:

$$
t = \frac{dr}{ds}.
$$

Construct a plane perpendicular to the first derivative at a given point of the curve. This plane is called the normal plane of the curve. The plane in which the first and the second derivatives of the curve lie is called an osculating plane. If the second derivative of the curve is parallel to the first derivative, or its length is equal to zero, one can take any plane in which the first derivative of the curve is situated as the osculating plane. A point of the curve at which the vectors of the first and the second derivatives of the curve are collinear is called a rectifying point. Rectifying points do not depend on the parameterization of the curve. The name osculating plane is due to the fact that it passes through a given point on the curve with the highest order of tangency, and can be defined as the limiting position of the plane constructed on three infinitely close points of the curve. A plane that is perpendicular to both a normal and an osculating plane is called a rectifying plane.

The unit vector orthogonal to the tangent vector lying in the osculating plane and directed towards the second derivative (in the direction of the concavity of the curve) is called the principal normal of the curve. Denote the principal normal as \( n \). Vectors of the first and the second derivatives of the curve with natural parameterization are orthogonal, because

$$
\frac{d(t \cdot t)}{ds} = 2t \cdot \frac{dt}{ds} = 2t \cdot \frac{d^2r}{ds^2} = 0.
$$

Hence, the second derivative of the curve with natural parameterization is directed along the principal normal.
$$
\frac{dt}{ds} = \frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} = kn.
$$

The coefficient \( k \) denotes the curvature of the curve. The inverted value of the curvature is equal to the radius of the circle tangent to the curve at the given point.

A unit vector along the line of intersection of the normal and the rectifying planes that forms a right-handed triple with the tangent and normal vectors is called a binormal of the curve, and is denoted as \( b \). A tangent vector \( t \), principal normal \( n \), and binormal \( b \) of the curve are shown in Fig. 1.1.1.

![Fig. 1.1.1.](image)

By definition, the binormal is orthogonal to the tangent vector and to the principal normal. Therefore, it follows that

$$
\frac{d(b \cdot t)}{ds} = t \cdot \frac{db}{ds} + b \cdot \frac{dt}{ds} = t \cdot \frac{db}{ds} = 0,
$$

$$
\frac{d(b \cdot b)}{ds} = 2b \cdot \frac{db}{ds} = 0.
$$

Thus, the derivative of the binormal with respect to the arc length of the curve is orthogonal to vectors \( t \) and \( b \), and hence it is parallel to the principal normal. It is usually written in the form

$$
\frac{db}{ds} = -\chi n.
$$

The coefficient \( \chi \) is called the torsion of the curve.

Using the derivatives of tangent and binormal vectors of the curve with natural parameterization, we find the derivative of the normal with respect to arc length:

$$
\frac{dn}{ds} = \frac{d(b \times t)}{ds} = \frac{db}{ds} \times t + b \times \frac{dt}{ds} = -\chi n \times t + kb \times n = \chi b - kt.
$$

The Frenet-Serret formulae
$$
\frac{dt}{ds} = kn, \quad \frac{dn}{ds} = \chi b - kt, \quad \frac{db}{ds} = -\chi n
$$

express the differential relations between tangent vector \( t \), principal normal \( n \), and binormal \( b \). Vectors \( t, n, \) and \( b \) are related by

$$
b = t \times n, \quad t = n \times b, \quad n = b \times t
$$

and can be used as the unit vectors of the local coordinate system associated with the curve.

The set of the normal, osculating, and rectifying planes, and the vectors \( t, n, b \), is called the moving trihedral of the curve. The torsion of the curve is equal to the angular rotation velocity of the moving trihedral around the tangent vector as it moves along the curve. When the torsion is zero, the curve is planar. The total vector of the angular rotation velocity of the moving trihedral with respect to the path traveled along the curve is called the Darboux vector. It is equal to

$$
\omega = kb + \chi t.
$$

The Darboux vector provides a mechanical meaning to the Frenet-Serret formulae, with which the latter have the form

$$
\frac{dt}{ds} = \omega \times t, \quad \frac{dn}{ds} = \omega \times n, \quad \frac{db}{ds} = \omega \times b.
$$

The curvature and torsion of a curve with natural parameterization can be calculated using the following formulae:

$$
k = \left| \frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} \right|, \quad \chi = \frac{1}{k^2} \left( \frac{dr}{ds} \times \frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} \right) \cdot \frac{d^3 r}{ds^3}.
$$

Typically, the parameterization of the curve is not natural. Using the above formulae for a curve with natural parameterization, we obtain the formulae relating the principal normal, binormal, curvature, and torsion to the derivatives of the curve for arbitrary parameterization. The derivatives of a curve with different parameterization are related by:

$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{dr}{ds} \frac{ds}{dt},
$$

$$
\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = \frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^2 + \frac{dr}{ds} \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2},
$$

$$
\frac{d^3 r}{dt^3} = \frac{d^3 r}{ds^3} \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^3 + 3 \frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} \frac{ds}{dt} \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} + \frac{dr}{ds} \frac{d^3 s}{dt^3}.
$$
In the general case, the curvature of the curve is calculated by the formula

$$ k = \frac{|r' \times r''|}{|r'|^3}. $$  

(1.1.3)

At the points of the curve with nonzero curvature, the principal normal, binormal, curvature radius \( \rho \), and torsion of the curve are calculated by the formulae

$$ k_n = \frac{r'' - r' \cdot r''}{|r'|^2}, \quad b = \frac{r' \times r''}{k |r'|^3}, \quad \rho = \frac{|r'|^3}{|r' \times r''|}, \quad \chi = \frac{(r' \times r'') \cdot r'''}{|r' \times r''|^2}. $$

(1.1.4)

It is obvious from the above formulae that the curvature is always non-negative, but the torsion may have any sign. If the curvature is zero, then the directions of the principal normal, binormal, and torsion are not defined. If the curvature is zero at every point of the curve, then the curve is a segment of a straight line. In this case the principal normal may have any direction in the normal plane. If the first, second, and third derivatives of the curve are parallel, then the torsion of the curve is zero and the curve is planar.

1.2. Analytic Curves

We will designate curves as analytic curves if their coordinates in some local coordinate system can be described by analytic functions without using points, vectors, or other curves.

Local coordinate systems, in which the curves have the canonical form, are used for analytic curves.

Construct a local rectangular Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at point \( p \) and the basis vectors \( i_x, i_y, i_z \). The curve with coordinates in the local system \( x(t), y(t), z(t) \) is described by the vector function

$$ r(t) = p + x(t) i_x + y(t) i_y + z(t) i_z. $$  

(1.2.1)

Let \( p_i \) be coordinates of the origin \( p \) of the local coordinate system, \( x_i \) â€“ components of the basis vector \( i_x \), \( y_i \) â€“ components of the basis vector \( i_y \), and \( z_i \) â€“ components of the basis vector \( i_z \), \( i=1,2,3 \). Then the analytical curve is a function

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
r_1(t) \\
r_2(t) \\
r_3(t)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
p_1 \\
p_2 \\
p_3
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\
x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\
x_3 & y_3 & z_3
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
x(t) \\
y(t) \\
z(t)
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

The coordinates of the curve (1.2.1) are
$$ r_i(t) = p_i + x(t) i_x + y(t) i_y + z(t) i_z. $$

By changing the position or orientation of the analytic curve described in this way, the coordinates of the origin of the local coordinate system and its basis vectors change, but analytic functions of the curve remain unchanged, keeping their canonical form.

Let us consider examples of analytic curves. We describe an elliptical arc by the vector function

$$ r(t) = p + a \cos t i_x + b \sin t i_y, \quad (1.2.2) $$
$$ t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}}, $$

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the ellipseâ€™s semi-axes, \( 0 \leq t_{\text{min}} < 2\pi \) is the initial arc parameter, and \( t_{\text{min}} < t_{\text{max}} \leq a + 2\pi \) is the final arc parameter. We place the origin \( p \) of the local coordinate system at the center of the ellipse. The basis vectors \( i_x \) and \( i_y \) are directed along its semi-axes. Scalar functions \( x(t) = a \cos t \) and \( y(t) = b \sin t \) of the ellipse are related by equation

$$ \left( \frac{x}{a} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{y}{b} \right)^2 = 1. $$

With the domain of the parameter \( t_{\text{max}} = t_{\text{min}} + 2\pi \) we get an ellipse. An ellipse is a periodic closed curve. It is shown in Fig. 1.2.1.

![Fig. 1.2.1.](image)

If \( t_{\text{max}} - t_{\text{min}} < 2\pi \), then we get an elliptical arc. When \( a = b \) and \( t_{\text{max}} = t_{\text{min}} + 2\pi \), we get a circle.

A hyperbolic arc can be described by the vector function

$$ r(t) = p + a \cosh t i_x + b \sinh t i_y, \quad (1.2.3) $$
$$ t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}}, $$

where \( a \) and \( b \) are the real and imaginary semi-axes of the hyperbola, \( t_{\text{min}} \) is the initial arc parameter, and \( t_{\text{min}} < t_{\text{max}} \) is the final arc parameter. Scalar functions \( x(t) = a \cosh t \) and \( y(t) = b \sinh t \) of a hyperbola are related by the equation

$$ \left( \frac{x}{a} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{y}{b} \right)^2 = 1. $$

We can describe a parabolic arc by the vector function

$$ r(t) = p + ft^2 i_x + 2ft i_y, $$
$$ t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}}, $$

where \( f \) is the focal length of the parabola, \( t_{\text{min}} \) is the initial arc parameter, and \( t_{\text{min}} < t_{\text{max}} \) is the final arc parameter. The scalar functions \( x(t) = ft^2 \) and \( y(t) = 2ft \) of a parabola are related by the equation

$$ 4fx - y^2 = 0. $$

The focus of the parabola is located at the point with radius vector \( p + fi_x \). The directrix of the parabola is a straight line \( r(w) = p - f i_x + w i_y \).

A helix of radius \( r \), with step \( h \) and parametric length \( t_{\text{max}} - t_{\text{min}} \), can be described by the vector function

$$ r(t) = p + r \cos t i_x + r \sin t i_y + \frac{ht}{2\pi} i_z. \quad (1.2.3) $$

We set the origin of the helix's local coordinate system at the intersection point of the axis and the end plane of the helix. The basis vector \( i_z \) is directed along the helix's axis. If the basis vectors in the local coordinate system are orthogonal and have equal lengths, we get a cylindrical helix; see Fig. 1.2.2.

![Fig. 1.2.2.](image)

When \( h = 0 \), formula (1.2.3) describes the radius vector of a circle or its arc in the plane of the basis vectors \( i_x \) and \( i_y \).

### 1.3. Curves Constructed on a Set of Points

Consider the curves passing through the given points \( p_0, p_1, ..., p_n \) when the parameter values are \( t_0, t_1, ..., t_n \). Points \( p_i, i = 0, 1, ..., n \) are called control points of the curve, and the parameters \( t_i, i = 0, 1, ..., n \) are called knots. The knot parameter value for each subsequent control point \( p_{i+1} \) must be greater than the knot parameter value of the previous control point \( p_i; \ t_i < t_{i+1}, \ i = 0, ..., n-1 \). Curves constructed on a set of equidistant knots are called uniform curves. For uniform curves the following equality is satisfied:

$$ t_i - t_{i-1} = t_{i+1} - t_i. $$

Curves constructed on a set of non-equidistant knots are called non-uniform curves.

A polyline is the simplest curve constructed on a set of points. It consists of segments sequentially connecting the given points. A radius vector of a polyline is
defined by

$$ r(t) = \frac{t_{i+1} - t}{t_{i+1} - t_i} p_i + \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i} p_{i+1}, $$  

(1.3.1)

where \( t_i \leq t \leq t_{i+1} \). The first derivative of the polyline at control points \( p_i \) has a discontinuity in length and direction. In some cases the parameter value at point \( p_i \) can be taken as the point number: \( t_i = i \). A polyline is shown in Fig. 1.3.1.

A polyline may be closed; in this case, the first control point is also the last one. The polyline has a number of favorable properties: to work with it require minimal computations, and the projection of a polyline is also a polyline.

![Fig. 1.3.1.](image)

We get a line segment when the polyline contains a single segment. The radius vector of the segment constructed on points \( p_0 \) and \( p_1 \) is calculated by the formula

$$ r(t) = (1-t)p_0 + tp_1, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1. $$

Curves constructed on a set of points and having a certain smoothness are called splines. The term "spline" for curves is borrowed from the name of a drawing toolâ€”an elastic flexible ruler that can be bent so as to pass through particular points.

The Lagrange interpolation formula allows constructing a curve on given points as

$$ r(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} L_i^n(t)p_i, \quad t \in [t_0, t_n], $$  

(1.3.2)

where the coefficients \( L_i^n(t) \) are equal to unity at \( t = t_i \) and equal to zero at the remaining knots \( t_j, j \neq i \).

The coefficients \( L_i^n(t) \) are polynomials of degree \( n-1 \)

$$ L_i^n(t) = \lambda_i(t - t_0)...(t - t_{i-1})(t - t_{i+1})...(t - t_n). $$

Setting \( L_i^n(t_i) = 1 \) implies that \( \frac{1}{\lambda_i} = (t_i - t_0)...(t_i - t_{i-1})(t_i - t_{i+1})...(t_i - t_n) \) and
Thus, the radius vector of the Lagrange spline is described by

$$ r(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{\prod_{j=0, j \neq i}^{n} (t - t_j)}{\prod_{j=0, j \neq i}^{n} (t_i - t_j)} p_i. $$  

(1.3.4)

The Lagrange spline can be written as

$$ r(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{W_{0,n}(t)}{(t - t_i)W_{0,n}'(t_i)} p_i, $$

where \( W_{0,n}(t) = (t - t_0)(t - t_1)...(t - t_{n-1})(t - t_n) \) and

$$ W_{0,n}'(t_i) = \left. \frac{dW_{0,n}}{dt} \right|_{t_i} = (t_i - t_0)...(t_i - t_{i-1})(t_i - t_{i+1})...(t_i - t_n). $$

The shape of the spline is affected not only by the location of the control points, but also by the values of the knots. In Fig. 1.3.2, we see a Lagrange spline in which the change of the knot parameter values is proportional to the distance between adjacent points

$$ \frac{t_{i+1} - t_i}{t_i - t_{i-1}} \approx \frac{|p_{i+1} - p_i|}{|p_i - p_{i-1}|}. $$

A Lagrange spline with uniform parameterization (\( t_i = i \)) is shown in Fig. 1.3.2 by the thin dashed line. One can see from Fig. 1.3.2 that the shape of the curve is influenced not only by the positions of the control points, but also by the corresponding parameter valuesâ€”i.e., by the curve parameterization.
The Newton spline passing through the given points takes the form

$$ r(t) = a_0 + a_1(t - t_0) + a_2(t - t_0)(t - t_1) + \ldots + a_n(t - t_0)(t - t_1)\ldots(t - t_{n-1}). $$ (1.3.5)

We derive vectors \( a_i \) from the conditions for the vector function \( r(t) \) to pass through the points \( p_i \) at parameter values \( t_i, i=0,1,\ldots,n \)

$$
\begin{align*}
p_0 &= a_0, \\
p_1 &= a_0 + a_1(t_1 - t_0), \\
p_2 &= a_0 + a_1(t_2 - t_0) + a_2(t_2 - t_0)(t_2 - t_1), \\
&\vdots \\
p_n &= a_0 + a_1(t_n - t_0) + a_2(t_n - t_0)(t_n - t_1) + \ldots + a_n(t_n - t_0)(t_n - t_1)\ldots(t_n - t_{n-1}). \quad (1.3.6)
\end{align*}
$$

The matrix of this system of equations is triangular and the system can be solved by direct iteration. The first equation of the system (1.3.6) provides \( a_0 \). Substituting this result into the second equation will yield \( a_1 \). From the third equation we find \( a_2 \), and continue similarly until we reach \( a_n \). Inserting an additional point \( p_{n+1} \) into the spline will extend the system (1.3.6) by one more equation, leaving the other equations unchanged. This is an advantage of the Newton spline over the Lagrange spline in the construction of curves with an increasing number of points. Formulas (1.3.2) and (1.3.5) describe the same curve. Lagrange and Newton splines are rarely used in geometric modeling because of their behavior, including strong dependence on the parametric values at the control points.

We construct a cubic spline, with continuous first and the second derivatives of the radius vector, on a given set of control points. We describe the radius vector of the curve at each segment between adjacent control points by a cubic polynomial. We
denote the second derivatives of the radius vector of the spline at control points \( t_i \) as \( s_i \). The second derivative of the radius vector of the spline on the segment \( t_i \leq t \leq t_{i+1} \), by definition, is a linear function of the parameter \( t \):

$$
\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = s_i \frac{t_{i+1} - t}{t_{i+1} - t_i} + s_{i+1} \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}.
$$

After double integration we obtain

$$
r(t) = s_i \frac{(t_{i+1} - t)^3}{6(t_{i+1} - t_i)} + s_{i+1} \frac{(t - t_i)^3}{6(t_{i+1} - t_i)} + c_1 t + c_2.
$$

Integration constants \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) can be determined from the boundary conditions of the segment \( r(t_i) = p_i \) and \( r(t_{i+1}) = p_{i+1} \). After calculation we obtain

$$
r(t) = s_i \frac{(t_{i+1} - t)^3}{6(t_{i+1} - t_i)} + s_{i+1} \frac{(t - t_i)^3}{6(t_{i+1} - t_i)} + \left( \frac{p_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i} - s_i \frac{t_{i+1} - t_i}{6} \right)(t_{i+1} - t) + \left( \frac{p_{i+1}}{t_{i+1} - t_i} - s_{i+1} \frac{t_{i+1} - t_i}{6} \right)(t - t_i).
$$  

(1.3.7)

Equation (1.3.7) describes a cubic polynomial on interval \( t_i \leq t \leq t_{i+1} \) and contains two unknown variables, \( s_i \) and \( s_{i+1} \). To define them, we set the first derivative of the spline at the right end of the segment \( t_{i+1} \leq t \leq t_i \) to the first derivative of the spline at the left end of the segment \( t_i \leq t \leq t_{i+1} \). After differentiating (1.3.7) and by substituting \( t = t_i \), we obtain

$$
\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{t_i} = \frac{(2s_i + s_{i+1})(t_{i+1} - t_i)}{6} + \frac{p_{i+1} - p_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}.
$$

After replacing \( i \) in (1.3.7) by \( i-1 \), we differentiate it and substitute \( t = t_i \). We get

$$
\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{t_i} = \frac{(2s_i + s_{i-1})(t_i - t_{i-1})}{6} + \frac{p_i - p_{i-1}}{t_i - t_{i-1}}.
$$

Equating the right-hand sides of the last two relations, we arrive at the following equation:

$$
s_{i-1}(t_i - t_{i-1}) + 2s_i(t_{i+1} - t_{i-1}) + s_{i+1}(t_{i+1} - t_i) = 6 \frac{p_{i+1} - p_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i} - 6 \frac{p_i - p_{i-1}}{t_i - t_{i-1}}.
$$  

(1.3.8)

These equations can be constructed for \( n-1 \) control points. The \( n+1 \) unknowns of
the vectors, $s_n$, must be determined. Two missing equations to determine all the unknowns are built from the boundary conditions of the curve. For example, if we assume that the ends of the curve are free, then we have $s_0 = s_n = 0$. In some cases, if we have $s_0 = s_1$, $s_n = s_{n-1}$, then the spline will have constant curvature at the endpoints. Additional conditions depend on the geometric conditions in each particular case. If it is necessary to construct a closed curve, then the number of unknowns will be the same as the number of equations. Thus, the unknown vectors of the second derivatives $s_i$ at the control points can be found from a system of linear equations. The matrix of this system of linear equations is tridiagonal, which simplifies the system. The right-hand side of (1.3.7) can be written as

$$ r(t) = (1 - w)p_i + wp_{i+1} + \left[(-2w + 3w^2 - w^3)s_i + (-w + w^3)s_{i+1}\right] \frac{(t_{i+1} - t_i)^2}{6}, $$

(1.3.9)

where $w = \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}$, and $t_i \leq t \leq t_{i+1}$. The resulting curve is called a cubic spline.

The shape of the spline is affected by the locations of the control points and by the knot values. If the parameter knot values can be chosen at will, then in order to avoid loops and unreasonable spline bending, it is desirable to use parameterization proportional to the natural parameterization of the spline. In natural parameterization of the curve, that parameter is assumed to be the length of the curve measured from a certain starting point. Good results are also obtained by parameterization, in which the change of parameter knot values is proportional to the distance between adjacent points.

Fig. 1.3.3 shows a cubic spline with parameter knot values changing in proportion to the distance between adjacent points. The thin dashed line in Fig. 1.3.3 indicates a cubic spline with uniform parameterization ($t_i = i$). With uniform parameterization, the shape of the spline is larger since the points are less evenly spaced.

It is possible to construct splines of higher degree by analogy with a cubic spline, when the third and higher-order derivatives of the radius vector are continuous at the control points. In the limiting case, when continuity of $n$-order derivatives at $n+1$ control points is preserved, we have a Lagrange or a Newton spline.

If we are given a sequence of $m+1$ points through which the curve must pass, and the derivatives of its radius vector at these points, we can use this information to construct a spline that is described by a polynomial of degree $2m+1$. These types of
splines are named after the French mathematician C. Hermite. We consider the special case of a Hermite spline for \( m = 1 \).

A polyline can be regarded as a composite curve constructed from segments of a straight line. By analogy, one can construct a composite cubic curve consisting of third-order Hermite splines smoothly conjoined to each other. Let us construct a composite Hermite spline passing through a given sequence of points and having the given derivatives at these points. Let the radius vectors of these points be \( p_i \), the derivative vectors of the curve at these points be \( q_i \), and the parameter value at these points be \( t_i \) (\( t_i < t_{i+1} \)), where \( i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1 \) â€” point numbers. Within the segment between the points \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \), the composite Hermite spline is a third-degree polynomial of the local parameter \( w \)

$$
r(w) = a_0 + wa_1 + w^2a_2 + w^3a_3, \quad w = \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i},
$$

as in Fig. 1.3.4.

![Fig. 1.3.4.](image)

The local parameter \( w \) varies from 0 to 1. We find vectors \( a_j, j = 0, 1, 2, 3 \) from the boundary conditions of the curve segment

$$
r_i(0) = p_i, \quad r_i(1) = p_{i+1}, \quad r_i'(0) = q_i, \quad r_i'(1) = q_{i+1}.
$$

After solving this system of equations and by substituting the values \( a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 \) we obtain the relation for the radius vector of the Hermite spline

$$
r(t) = (1 - 3w^2 + 2w^3)p_i + (3w^2 - 2w^3)p_{i+1} + (w - 2w^2 + w^3)(t_{i+1} - t_i)q_i + (-w^2 + w^3)(t_{i+1} - t_i)q_{i+1} =
$$

$$
= a_0(w)p_i + a_1(w)p_{i+1} + b_0(w)(t_{i+1} - t_i)q_i + b_1(w)(t_{i+1} - t_i)q_{i+1}, \quad (1.3.10)
$$

where \( w = \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, \quad t_i \leq t \leq t_{i+1} \). The following notation for functions is introduced in (1.3.10):

$$
\begin{align*}
a_0(w) &= 1 - 3w^2 + 2w^3, \\
a_1(w) &= 3w^2 - 2w^3, \\
b_0(w) &= w - 2w^2 + w^3, \\
b_1(w) &= -w^2 + w^3. \quad (1.3.11)
\end{align*}
$$
The Hermite spline can be constructed when the derivatives at the control points are not given. If derivatives $q_i$ are unknown, they can be determined by constructing a vector Lagrange polynomial of second degree on three adjacent points $p_{i-1}$, $p_i$, $p_{i+1}$:

$$ p(t) = p_{i-1} \frac{(t-t_i)(t-t_{i+1})}{(t_{i-1}-t_i)(t_{i-1}-t_{i+1})} + p_i \frac{(t-t_{i-1})(t-t_{i+1})}{(t_i-t_{i-1})(t_i-t_{i+1})} + p_{i+1} \frac{(t-t_{i-1})(t-t_i)}{(t_{i+1}-t_{i-1})(t_{i+1}-t_i)}, $$

and, using $q_i$ as its derivative at $t=t_i$,

$$ q_i = p_{i-1} \frac{t_i-t_{i+1}}{(t_{i-1}-t_i)(t_{i-1}-t_{i+1})} + p_i \frac{2t_i-t_{i-1}-t_{i+1}}{(t_i-t_{i-1})(t_i-t_{i+1})} + p_{i+1} \frac{t_i-t_{i-1}}{(t_{i+1}-t_{i-1})(t_{i+1}-t_i)}. $$

Derivatives at the endpoints of the spline can be derived from the condition that the second derivatives of the radius vector must vanish at these points. For this purpose we calculate the second derivatives for corresponding segments using (1.3.10) and by substitution of appropriate parameter values. As a result we obtain

$$ q_0 = \frac{3}{2} \frac{p_1-p_0}{t_1-t_0} - \frac{1}{2} q_1, \quad q_n = \frac{3}{2} \frac{p_n-p_{n-1}}{t_n-t_{n-1}} - \frac{1}{2} q_{n-1}. $$

A third-degree composite Hermite spline with change of knot-parameter values proportional to the distance between adjacent control points is shown in Fig. 1.3.5. The thin dashed line in Fig. 1.3.5 indicates the composite Hermite spline of third degree with uniform parameterization ($t_i=i$).

![Fig. 1.3.5.](image)

A composite Hermite spline gives a reasonable approximation and requires less computation than the splines mentioned earlier. The second derivatives of the composite Hermite spline generally do not preserve continuity at the control points.

In Fig. 1.3.6 there are: A Lagrange spline (1), a cubic spline (2), and a composite Hermite spline (3), constructed using the identical data. We see that the splines behave differently.
Hermite and cubic splines are constructed for the purpose of an approximation. For ergonomic purposes, we use curves, which we shall consider further.

1.4. Bezier Curves

F. De Casteljauâ€”and independently, P. Bezierâ€”suggested the construction of curves where each point is calculated as a weighted sum of the given control points \( p_i \), \( i=0,1,\ldots,n \). These curves were named Bezier curves.

A Bezier curve of the first order (\( n=1 \)) is a segment

$$
r(t) = (1-t)p_0 + tp_1.
$$

The radius vector of the second-order (\( n=2 \)) Bezier curve is described by the relation

$$
r(t) = (1-t)^2p_0 + 2(1-t)tp_1 + t^2p_2.
$$

The radius vector of the cubic Bezier curve (\( n=3 \)) is described by the relation

$$
r(t) = (1-t)^3p_0 + 3(1-t)^2tp_1 + 3(1-t)t^2p_2 + t^3p_3.
$$

Fig. 1.4.1 shows a cubic Bezier curve and a polyline constructed on the same control points.
In the general case, the Bezier curve is described by the formula

$$ r(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} B^n_i(t)p_i = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} t^i (1-t)^{n-i} p_i , \quad t \in [0,1]. $$  \hspace{1cm} (1.4.1)

Points \( p_i \) are used in construction of the control polyline of the Bezier curve. Fig. 1.4.2 shows a Bezier curve constructed on eight points, as well as its control polyline.

The parameter domain of a Bezier curve of any degree lies in the unit interval: \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \). A Bezier curve does not pass through any of its control points except the endpoints. Its control polyline is tangent to the Bezier curve at the endpoints. The smoothness of the Bezier curve is defined by the number of points. A Bezier curve can be given any desired shape by moving one or more control points.

A.R. Forrest established a link between coefficients at the control points of the Bezier curve and Bernstein polynomials. The coefficients at the control points of a Bezier curve are Bernstein functions

$$ r^{(n-1)}_i(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} B^{n-1}_i(t)p_{i+1}. $$  \hspace{1cm} (1.4.2)

A set of Bernstein functions for \( n \) is called its Bernstein basis. The coefficients at
$t^i(1-t)^{n-i}$ in (1.4.2) are equal to coefficients $r(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} f_i(t)p_i$, of the binomial formula: $Lr(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(t)p_{i-1}$. From this it follows that the Bernstein basis is a partition of unity:

$$r(t) = ((1-t)+tE)^n p_0$$

(1.4.3)

Fig. 1.4.3 and Fig. 1.4.4 show the Bernstein bases of third and fourth order, respectively.

Among Bernstein polynomials, only zero- and maximum-degree polynomials have maximum possible values $B^n_0(0) = 1$, $B^n_n(1) = 1$; that is why the Bezier curve passes only through initial $p_0$ and end $p_n$ points.

Bernstein functions satisfy the recurrence relation

$$B^n_i(t) = tB^{n-1}_{i-1}(t) + (1-t)B^{n-1}_i(t).$$

(1.4.4)

This relation is proved by direct substitution:

$$tB^{n-1}_{i-1}(t) + (1-t)B^{n-1}_i(t) = \frac{i}{n} \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} t^i(1-t)^{n-i} + \frac{n-i}{n} \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} t^i(1-t)^{n-i} = B^n_i(t).$$

Using this recurrence relation, we can compute all Bernstein functions. We start our calculations with the function $B^0_0(t) = 1$, then we obtain $B^1_1(t) = t$, $B^1_0(t) = 1-t$, ..., $B^n_0(t) = (1-t)^n$, $B^n_n(t) = t^n$. In this calculation it is assumed that the functions with one negative index are equal to zero.

Substitute the recurrence relation (1.4.4) into (1.4.1), single out the endpoints, and use the fact that $B^n_0(t) = (1-t)^n$, $B^n_n(t) = t^n$ to obtain
$$ r(t) = p_0 (1-t)^n + p_n t^n + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( t B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) + (1-t) B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) \right) p_i = $$

$$ = (1-t) \left( p_0 (1-t)^{n-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) p_i \right) + t \left( p_n t^{n-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) p_i \right) = $$

$$ = (1-t) \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) p_i + t \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) p_{i+1} = $$

$$ (1-t) r_0^{(n-1)}(t) + t r_1^{(n-1)}(t), $$

where \( r_0^{(n-1)}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) p_i, \quad r_1^{(n-1)}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} B_{n-i}^{n-1}(t) p_{i+1}. \)

Continuing this process of decomposition for \( r_0^{(n-1)} \) and \( r_1^{(n-1)} \), we finally arrive at the following equalities

$$ r_i^{(0)} = \sum_{j=0}^{0} B_{0}^{0}(t) p_i = p_i, \quad i = 0, 1, \ldots, n. $$

Denoting \( r(t) \) as \( r_0^{(n)}(t) \), and \( p_i \) as \( r_i^{(0)} \) we obtain a recurrence relation for calculating the point of the Bezier curve at \( k \)-th iteration of the recurrence relation

$$ r_i^{(k)} = (1-t) r_i^{(k-1)} + t r_{i+1}^{(k-1)}, \quad i + k \leq n. \tag{1.4.5} $$

The algorithm described by (1.4.5) is called De Casteljau's algorithm. De Casteljau's algorithm allows us to calculate any point of the Bezier curve using the control points without knowing anything about the Bernstein functions. A Bezier curve can be defined as a curve with points defined by the recurrence relation (1.4.5).

We illustrate De Casteljau's algorithm by an example of quadratic Bezier curve; see Fig. 1.4.5.

![Fig. 1.4.5.](image)

A point with an arbitrary parameter \( t \) of a quadratic Bezier curve has the property that the tangent line at this point divides vectors \( p_1 - p_0 \) and \( p_2 - p_1 \) in the ratio \( \frac{t}{1-t} \). This follows from the notation of the Bezier curve of the second degree in the form
$$ r(t) = (1-t)(p_1 + (p_0 - p_1)(1-t)) + t(p_1 + (p_2 - p_1)t). $$

A point of the curve divides the segment of the tangent confined inside the control polyline in the same ratio. Thus, \( r_0^{(0)} = p_0, \ r_1^{(0)} = p_1, \ r_2^{(0)} = p_2 \), point A has the radius vector \( r_0^{(1)} \), point B has the radius vector \( r_1^{(1)} \), point C has the radius vector \( r_0^{(2)} = r(t) \). For the curves represented as \( r(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} f_i(t)p_i \), we define right-shift operator \( E \) and left-shift operator \( L \). The effects of these operators are described by

$$ Er(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f_i(t)p_{i+1}, \quad Lr(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i(t)p_{i-1}. $$

The shift operators are used in a compact form of De Casteljau's algorithm. If an operator is repeated \( i \) times, we use the powers of operators \( E \) and \( L \), for example \( E^i \) and \( L^i \).

Let us represent the control points \( p_i \) as curves \( p_i = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \delta_j^i p_j \), where \( \delta_j^i = 1 \) for \( i = j \) and \( \delta_j^i = 0 \) for \( i \neq j \).

The Bezier curve constructed on the control points \( p_i, \ i = 0, 1, ..., n \), may be written as

$$ r(t) = ((1-t) + tE)^n p_0 \quad \text{or} \quad r(t) = ((1-t)L + t)^n p_n. $$

Indeed, \( ((1-t) + tE)^n p_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{nt}^i (1-t)^{n-i} E^i p_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n} B_{ni}(t)p_i \) due to \( E^i p_0 = p_i \).

Similarly, \( ((1-t)L + t)^n p_0 = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{nt}^i (1-t)^{n-i} L^{n-i} p_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n} B_{ni}(t)p_i \) due to \( L^{n-i} p_n = p_i \).

### 1.5. Bezier Curves and Conic Sections

A quadratic Bezier curve

$$ r(t) = (1-t)^2 p_0 + 2(1-t)t p_1 + t^2 p_2 \quad (1.5.1) $$

is a planar curve and represents the second-degree polynomial of a parameter. Ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas are represented as second-degree functions of the coordinates. A question arises: is it possible to represent some part of a conic section by a second-order Bezier curve?

Suppose \( l_1 = a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 \) and \( l_2 = a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are Cartesian
coordinates in some two-dimensional space, and \(a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2, b_2, c_2\) are some numbers. Then equalities \(l_1=0\) and \(l_2=0\) are equations for straight lines in two-dimensional space. Let \(l_1=0\) and \(l_2=0\) be the equations of two distinct straight lines. Then equation \(l_1 l_2 = 0\) describes a conic section in this plane. Let us choose another pair of straight lines described by equations \(l_3=0\) and \(l_4=0\) \((l_3=a_3x+b_3y+c_3, \ l_4=a_4x+b_4y+c_4)\). Suppose the second pair of lines intersect the first pair of lines, and result in the equation

$$(1-\lambda)l_1 l_2 + \lambda l_3 l_4 = 0,$$  

(1.5.2)

where \(\lambda\) â€” some parameter. The equation (1.5.2) describes a family of conic sections passing through the four points of intersection of two pairs of lines; see Fig. 1.5.1. As line \(l_3\) approaches line \(l_4\), point \(A\) approaches point \(B\), point \(C\) approaches point \(D\), and chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) tend to the tangent lines of the conic sections of the set. When lines \(l_3\) and \(l_4\) coincide,

$$(1-\lambda)l_1 l_2 + \lambda l_3^2 = 0,$$  

(1.5.3)

which represents a family of conic sections tangent to the lines \(l_1\) and \(l_2\) at their points of intersection with the line \(l_3\) (see Fig. 1.5.2). If we specify yet another point \(R\), distinct from points \(A\) and \(C\), we thereby define a conic section and the parameter \(\lambda\) in (1.5.3). The conic section in this case is defined by four points: \(A, C, R,\) and \(E\) as the point of intersection of straight lines \(l_1\) and \(l_2\).

Let us try to describe the part of a conic section which lies inside triangle \(AEC\) by a quadratic Bezier curve constructed on the control polyline with vertices \(A, E,\) and \(C\). Let the radius vectors of the points \(A, E, C\) be equal to \(p_0, p_1, p_2\), respectively. We introduce an oblique coordinate system in the plane with its origin at \(p_1\), and its coordinate basis being vectors \(p_0-p_1\) and \(p_2-p_1\). The coordinates of this system are denoted by \(u\) and \(v\). In the oblique system \(uv\), vector \(p_0\) has coordinates \(u=1\) and \(v=0\);
vector \( p_1 \) has coordinates \( u=0 \) and \( v=0 \); and vector \( p_2 \) has coordinates \( u=0 \) and \( v=1 \). The position of an arbitrary point with coordinates \( u \) and \( v \) is then described by the radius vector

$$
r(u,v) = p_1 + u(p_0 - p_1) + v(p_2 - p_1).
$$  

(1.5.4)

In an oblique coordinate system, straight lines \( l_1, l_2, l_3 \) are described by equations \( v=0 \), \( u=0 \), and \( u+v-1=0 \), respectively. Substituting them into (1.5.3), we obtain the equation

$$
(1-\lambda)uv + \lambda(u+v-1)^2 = 0,
$$

(1.5.5)

which describes a family of conic sections in the oblique coordinate system. Denote the left-hand side of equation (1.5.5) as \( S(u,v) \).

Suppose we choose some conic section from the family of (1.5.3), for which the parameter \( \lambda \) in (1.5.3) is known. Let us choose some point \( r \) of the conic section inside the triangle with vertices at points \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \); see Fig. 1.5.3.

![Fig. 1.5.3.](image)

Let the coordinates of the point be \( 0<u_0<1 \) and \( 0<v_0<1 \). In general, we can assume that the conic section is described by the function (1.5.4), in which the parameters \( u \) and \( v \) are related by (1.5.5). Let us express the radius vector of the conic section as a function of one parameter, which in turn is a function of \( u \) and \( v \). In order to do this, we need the tangent to the conic section at \( r(u_0,v_0) \) and also the points of intersection of this tangent with the axes of the oblique coordinate system to be known.

A tangent to the conic section (1.5.5), written as \( S(u,v) = 0 \), at the point with coordinates \( u=u_0 \) and \( v=v_0 \), is described by the equation

$$
\left. \frac{\partial S}{\partial u} \right|_{u_0,v_0} (u-u_0) + \left. \frac{\partial S}{\partial v} \right|_{u_0,v_0} (v-v_0) = 0.
$$

If we take into account the fact that \( u_0, v_0 \) satisfy (1.5.5), derivatives \( \partial S/\partial u \) and \( \partial S/\partial v \) at \( r(u_0,v_0) \) are equal to
$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial u}\bigg|_{u_0, v_0} = (1 - \lambda)v_0 + 2\lambda(u_0 + v_0 - 1) = \lambda \frac{(u_0 + v_0 - 1)(u_0 - v_0 + 1)}{u_0},
$$

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial v}\bigg|_{u_0, v_0} = (1 - \lambda)u_0 + 2\lambda(u_0 + v_0 - 1) = \lambda \frac{(u_0 + v_0 - 1)(v_0 - u_0 + 1)}{v_0}.
$$

Thus, the equation of the tangent to the conic section at \( r(u_0, v_0) \) has the form

$$
(u_0 - v_0 + 1)v_0(u - u_0) + (v_0 - u_0 + 1)u_0(v - v_0) = 0.
$$

It intersects the coordinate axes \( u \) and \( v \) at the points

$$
u_1 = u_0 + u_0 \frac{v_0 - u_0 + 1}{u_0 - v_0 + 1} = \frac{2u_0}{u_0 - v_0 + 1}, \quad v_1 = 0,
$$

$$
v_2 = v_0 + v_0 \frac{u_0 - v_0 + 1}{v_0 - u_0 + 1} = \frac{2v_0}{v_0 - u_0 + 1}, \quad u_2 = 0,
$$

as shown in Fig. 1.5.4.

The tangent to the conic section divides vectors \( p_0 - p_1 \) and \( p_1 - p_2 \) into segments. We denote the ratios of the segment lengths as

$$
z_1 = \frac{u_1}{1 - u_1} = \frac{2u_0}{1 - u_0 - v_0}, \quad z_2 = \frac{v_2}{1 - v_2} = \frac{2v_0}{1 - u_0 - v_0}. \tag{1.5.6}
$$

Point \( r(u_0, v_0) \) of the conic section can be characterized by coordinates \( u_0, v_0 \), or by coordinates \( u_1, v_2 \), or by the ratios \( z_1, z_2 \). Let us consider the last characterization. We express \( u_0 \) and \( v_0 \) using \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) and (1.5.6)

$$
u_0 = \frac{z_1}{2 + z_1 + z_2}, \quad v_0 = \frac{z_2}{2 + z_1 + z_2}. \tag{1.5.7}
$$
Substituting (1.5.7) into (1.5.4), we obtain the radius vector of the conic section as a function of parameters \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \).

$$
r(z_1, z_2) = \frac{z_1 p_0 + 2p_1 + z_2 p_2}{z_1 + 2 + z_2}. \tag{1.5.8}
$$

Parameters \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) are related by

$$
z_1 z_2 = \frac{4u_0 v_0}{(1 - u_0 - v_0)^2} = \frac{-4\lambda}{1 - \lambda},
$$

i.e., the product \( z_1 z_2 = \text{const} \) for a given conic section. Practically, the radius vector of the conic section depends on a single parameter.

Let us introduce the parameter \( t \) for the conic section. Parameters \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) depend on \( t \). From (1.5.5) it follows that

$$
\frac{u_0 v_0}{(1 - u_0 - v_0)^2} = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - 1}.
$$

Substituting this into (1.5.6), we obtain

$$
z_1 = \frac{1}{w} \sqrt{\frac{u_0}{v_0}}, \quad z_2 = \frac{1}{w} \sqrt{\frac{v_0}{u_0}},
$$

where \( w = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda - 1}{4\lambda}} \) â€“ constant coefficients. For conic section parameter \( t \), we use

$$
t = \frac{\sqrt{v_0}}{\sqrt{u_0} + \sqrt{v_0}}. \text{Then}
$$

$$
z_1 = \frac{1}{w} \left( \frac{1 - t}{t} \right), \quad z_2 = \frac{1}{w} \left( \frac{t}{1 - t} \right). \tag{1.5.9}
$$

We substitute these last equalities in (1.5.8) to express the radius vector of the conic section (1.5.4) as a function of a single parameter \( t \)

$$
r(t) = \frac{(1 - t)^2 p_0 + 2t(1 - t)wp_1 + t^2 p_2}{(1 - t)^2 + 2t(1 - t)w + t^2}. \tag{1.5.10}
$$

The coefficient

$$
w = \frac{1}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda - 1}{4\lambda}} = \frac{1 - u_0 - v_0}{\sqrt{4u_0 v_0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{z_1 z_2}}, \tag{1.5.11}
$$
is called the weight of the point \( p_i \).

Let us compare the expressions for the radius vector of the second-order Bezier curve (1.5.1) and for the radius vector of the conic section (1.5.10). They are similar when \( w = 1 \), which is valid for one of the curves from the conic section family with \( \lambda = -1/3 \). The conic section (1.5.5) for \( \lambda = -1/3 \) is described by the equation

$$
u^2 - 2uv + v^2 - 2u - 2v + 1 = 0
$$

and represents a parabola. Indeed, if we introduce new variables \( x = u - v, \ y = 2u + 2v - 1 \), they will be related by the parabolic equation

$$
y = x^2.
$$

Let us consider the relation (1.5.10) as a generalization of the quadratic curveâ€”which, in special cases, allows us to obtain both the second-order Bezier curve and the conic section.

We can now answer the question posed above: While it is impossible to describe the conic section in the general case by the second-order Bezier curve, it can be done using a similar curve (1.5.10). The second-order Bezier curve can also be described as a special case of the curve (1.5.10).

Let us use (1.5.10) to construct an arc of a circle with radius \( \rho \) and opening angle \( \alpha \), as shown in Fig. 1.5.5. By \( p_0 \) and \( p_2 \) we denote the radius vectors of the arc endpoints, and by \( p_1 \) we denote the point of intersection of the lines tangent to the arc at its endpoints.

![Fig. 1.5.5.](image)

Using the symmetry of the arc about line \( OC \), we find the weight \( w \) from (1.5.11). From similarity of triangles it follows that

$$
\frac{1}{w} = z_1 = z_2 = \frac{BC}{AB},
$$

The lengths of segments \( BC \) and \( AB \) are calculated from the radius \( \rho \) and the opening angle \( \alpha \)

$$
AB = \rho(1 - \cos(\alpha/2)), \quad BC = CO - BO = \frac{\rho}{\cos(\alpha/2)} - \rho = \rho \frac{1 - \cos(\alpha/2)}{\cos(\alpha/2)}.
$$
Therefore, \( w = \frac{AB}{BC} = \cos\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \).

Thus, the arc of a circle with radius \( p \) and opening angle \( \alpha \) can be constructed as a quadratic curve (1.5.10) given by points \( p_0, p_2, \) and \( p_1 \), with midpoint weight \( w = \cos(\alpha/2) \). The radius vector of the arc is described by the function

$$
r(t) = \frac{(1-t)^2 p_0 + 2t(1-t)\cos(\alpha/2)p_1 + t^2 p_2}{(1-t)^2 + 2t(1-t)\cos(\alpha/2) + t^2}, \quad t \in [0,1], \tag{1.5.12}
$$

where the points are related by

$$
|p_0 - p_1| = |p_2 - p_1| = p \tan(\alpha/2);
$$
$$
(p_0 - p_1) \cdot (p_2 - p_1) = |p_0 - p_1| |p_2 - p_1| \cos \alpha.
$$

The parametric arc length is equal to unity. Formula (1.5.12) is valid in the range of angles \( 0 < \alpha < 2\pi \). Fig. 1.5.6 and 1.5.7 show circular arcs with angles \( 2/3\pi \) and \( 4/3\pi \) respectively. The two arcs have the same control points, but in the first case the weight of the midpoint is equal to 0.5, while in the second case, the weight of the midpoint is equal to -0.5.

Construct a quarter-ellipse on three vertices \( p_0, p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) with the help of (1.5.10); see Fig. 1.5.8. Vectors \( p_0 - p_1 \) and \( p_2 - p_1 \) are orthogonal. The lengths of these vectors are \( a = |p_0 - p_1| \) and \( b = |p_2 - p_1| \); the vectors define the semi-axes of the ellipse. In oblique coordinates \( u \) and \( v \), shown in Fig. 1.5.4, the equation of an ellipse is given by the equation of a circle: \((u-1)^2 + (v-1)^2 = 1\), corresponding to \( \lambda = -1 \) in (1.5.5). In accordance with (1.5.11), the weight of the point \( p_1 \) is

$$
w = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},
$$

the same as for a quarter-circle arc.
Consider the general case of constructing a conic section. We assume that the three vertices of the control polyline of the curve, \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \), and the fourth point \( r \), situated on the conic section, are known. Point \( r \) must lie in the same plane as the points \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \); see Fig. 1.5.9.

Construct the conic section in the form (1.5.10), assuming the weight of the vertex \( p_1 \) to be a function of the position of the fourth point \( r \) relative to the first three points:

$$
w(r) = \frac{1 - u_0 - v_0}{\sqrt{4u_0v_0}}.
$$

Oblique coordinates \( u_0 \) and \( v_0 \) of point \( r \)â€”used to calculate the weightâ€”are equal to the ratios of the vector lengths \( |r-r_v|/|p_0-p_1| \) and \( |r-r_u|/|p_2-p_1| \) respectively. Denote the triangle area \( p_1p_0r \) as \( S_1 \), the triangle area \( p_1p_2r \) as \( S_2 \), and the triangle area \( p_0p_1p_2 \) as \( S \); then

$$
u_0 = \frac{|r-r_v|}{|p_0-p_1|} = \frac{S_2}{S}, \quad v_0 = \frac{|r-r_u|}{|p_2-p_1|} = \frac{S_1}{S}.
$$

This is derived from relations \( S=0.5|p_0-p_1||p_2-p_1|\sin\alpha \), \( S_1=0.5|p_0-p_1||r-r_u|\sin\alpha \), and \( S_2=0.5|p_2-p_1||r-r_v|\sin\alpha \), where \( \alpha \) â€” angle \( p_0p_1p_2 \). In our notation midpoint weight is
expressed in terms of the triangle areas by

$$ w = \frac{S - S_1 - S_2}{\sqrt{4S_1S_2}}. $$

The weight \( w \) of point \( p_1 \) can be found if \( S_1S_2 \neq 0 \)â€”that is, if the point \( r \) does not belong to lines \( p_0p_1 \) and \( p_2p_1 \). In general, weight may be either positive or negative. As can be seen from Fig. 1.5.6 and Fig. 1.5.7, if the point \( r \) is located inside the triangle \( p_0p_1p_2 \), the weight of point \( p_1 \) is positive. But if point \( r \) is located outside the triangle \( p_0p_1p_2 \), the weight of the point \( p_1 \) is negative.

The sign of the second invariant \( I = \frac{3\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 1}{4} \) of the conic section (1.5.5) describes the type of a curve: if \( I > 0 \), then the conic section is elliptical; if \( I < 0 \), then it is hyperbolic; and if \( I = 0 \), it is parabolic. From (1.5.11) it follows that at \( |w| < 1 \), the curve (1.5.10) describes a segment of an ellipse; at \( |w| > 1 \) it (1.5.10) describes a segment of a hyperbola; and at \( |w| = 1 \), curve (1.5.10) describes a segment of a parabola.

### 1.6. Rational Bezier Curves

Formula (1.5.10) has an asymmetrical form, because the coefficient \( w \) is attributed only to the point \( p_1 \). By multiplying the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side of (1.5.10) by some number \( w_0 \), we obtain

$$ r(t) = \frac{(1-t)^2 w_0 p_0 + 2t(1-t) w_1 p_1 + t^2 w_2 p_2}{(1-t)^2 w_0 + 2t(1-t) w_1 + t^2 w_2}, $$

where \( w_1 = w_0 w \). Replace \( w_0 \) by some number \( w_2 \) in the last terms of numerator and denominator of the right-hand side of the equality. After these manipulations, control points \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \) will have coefficients \( w_0, w_1, w_2 \) respectively, and the formula (1.5.10) will have a symmetric form. As a result, we obtain the curve

$$ r(t) = \frac{(1-t)^2 w_0 p_0 + 2t(1-t) w_1 p_1 + t^2 w_2 p_2}{(1-t)^2 w_0 + 2t(1-t) w_1 + t^2 w_2} = \sum_{i=0}^{2} B_i^2 w_i p_i, \quad (1.6.1) $$

Coefficients \( w_0, w_1, w_2 \) are called the weights of the control points.

We use this result to generalize Bezier curves of arbitrary degree. By analogy with (1.6.1) we can write out the formula for calculating the radius vector of the Bezier curve constructed on an arbitrary number of vertices \( n \) in the form
$$ r(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} B''_i(t) w_i p_i}{\sum_{i=0}^{n} B''_i(t) w_i}, \quad t \in [0,1], \tag{1.6.2} $$

where \( B''_i(t) \) â€“ Bernstein functions (1.4.2). In general, each control point \( p_i \) of the curve (1.6.2) has its own weight \( w_i \). Curves having weights attributed to their control points are called rational. Curve (1.6.2) is called a rational Bezier curve of degree \( n \).

In general, we can always transfer from a rational Bezier curve of degree \( n \) to a rational Bezier curve of degree \( n+1 \). To do this we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator of the right-hand side of equation (1.6.2) by a number \( t+(1-t) \), which is equal to unity, and rearrange the terms.

Let us illustrate this by an example of a rational quadratic Bezier curve. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the right-hand side of (1.6.1) by the number \( t+(1-t) \) that is equal to unity, rearranging terms by order of multiplication of \( t \) and \( (1-t) \), we get the following expression as a result:

$$ r(t) = \frac{(1-t)^3 w_0 p_0 + t(1-t)^2 (2w_1 p_1 + w_0 p_0) + t^2 (1-t)(2w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2) + t^3 w_2 p_2}{(1-t)^3 w_0 + t(1-t)^2 (2w_1 + w_0) + t^2 (1-t)(2w_1 + w_2) + t^3 w_2}. $$

We can represent the right-hand side of this equality by a cubic Bezier curve. To do this, we introduce the notation for weights and vertices on the right-hand side of the last expression

$$ w_0^* = w_0, \quad w_1^* = \frac{2w_1 + w_0}{3}, \quad w_2^* = \frac{2w_1 + w_2}{3}, \quad w_0^* = w_2, $$
$$ p_0^* = p_0, \quad p_1^* = \frac{2w_1 p_1 + w_0 p_0}{3w_1^*}, \quad p_2^* = \frac{2w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2}{3w_2^*}, \quad p_3^* = p_2. $$

With this the quadratic curve (1.6.1) takes the form of a cubic curve (omit the asterisks in the notation of the control points and the weights):

$$ r(t) = \frac{(1-t)^3 w_0 p_0 + 3t(1-t)^2 w_1 p_1 + 3t^2 (1-t)w_2 p_2 + t^3 w_3 p_3}{(1-t)^3 w_0 + 3t(1-t)^2 w_1 + 3t^2 (1-t)w_2 + t^3 w_3} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{3} B^3_i w_i p_i}{\sum_{i=0}^{3} B^3_i w_i}. $$

The resulting cubic curve is identical to the original quadratic curve, but its control polyline and control-point weights are different. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the right-hand side of the last equality by nonzero \( t+(1-t) \), we turn it into a rational Bezier curve of the fourth degree, which describes the same conic section. This process can be continued further.

If we assume that in the denominator of the right-hand side of (1.6.2), \( w(t) \) is the weight of the radius vector of the curve \( r(t) \), then it can be regarded as an additional
coordinate. The formula for its calculation using vertex weights is identical to the formula for calculation of the coordinates of the radius vector through coordinates of the vertices. It is convenient to use homogeneous coordinates when dealing with points that have weights

$$
P = \begin{bmatrix} wp_1 \\ wp_2 \\ wp_3 \\ w \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} wp \\ w \end{bmatrix},
$$

(1.6.3)

where \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) are the coordinates of the point \( p \), and \( w \) is the weight of the point. In terms of homogeneous coordinates, the radius vector of a rational Bezier curve is described by an equation that is similar to the equation for the Bezier curve (1.4.1) in its form

$$
R(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} B^n_i(t)p_i, \quad t \in [0,1].
$$

The weight of the point is subject to the same transformation as its coordinates, so one can work with homogeneous coordinates of the radius vector without isolation of the Cartesian coordinates. We obtain the Cartesian coordinates of a rational curve by dividing the homogeneous coordinates by the additional coordinate.

The radius vector of a rational curve is calculated as the quotient of two functions of the curve parameter; thus, when calculating the derivative of a rational curve, the right-hand side should be viewed as a composite function. If we denote the radius vector of a rational curve as \( r = \frac{wr}{w} \), then the derivative of the radius vector of the rational curve is determined by the formula

$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{1}{w} \frac{d(wr)}{dt} - \frac{wr}{w^2} \frac{dw}{dt}.
$$

If the weights of all the control points are equal, then they can be taken outside the summation and eliminated. Then, with the help of Bernstein polynomials (1.4.3), the rational Bezier curve (1.6.2.) becomes equal to an ordinary Bezier curve (1.4.1).

The presence of weights of the control points provides additional opportunities for editing the curve. Replace the weight \( w_j \) with \( w_j + \Delta w \). Then the curve (1.6.2) changes to the curve

$$
r^*(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n} B^n_i(t)w_ip_i + B^n_j(t)\Delta wp_j}{\sum_{i=0}^{n} B^n_i(t)w_i + B^n_j(t)\Delta w} = \frac{r(t) + \delta(t)p_j}{1 + \delta(t)},
$$

where \( \delta(t) = \frac{B^n_j(t)\Delta w}{\sum_{i=0}^{n} B^n_i(t)w_i} \). Hence, for any \( \Delta w > 0 \), the point of the original curve is
translated to the point \( p_j \) and its new position \( r(t)^* \) divides the segment starting at \( r(t) \) and ending at the point \( p_j \) in the ratio \( 1:\delta(t) \). Fig. 1.6.1 shows rational Bezier curves of the fifth degree constructed on the same control points with weights equal to unity for all points, except the point \( p_3 \). We see that the greater the relative weight of the point, the closer the rational Bezier curve to this point. If the weight of the point is negative, then the point seems to push away the curve.

Fig. 1.6.1.

Despite great capabilities, Bezier curves have some limitationsâ€”namely, the order of curves is tightly connected with the number of points; the parameter domain of the curves is predetermined; and curves cannot be periodic and closed.

### 1.7. Divided Differences

Divided differences are used to construct splines. Scalar functions are constructed on the basis of divided differences. Scalar functions are generalizations of Bernstein functions and are widely used in geometric modeling.

Suppose we know the values \( f(t_i) \) of some function \( f(t) \) for the parameter values \( t_i \). The first-order divided differences are the following:

$$
f[t_0, t_1] = \frac{f(t_1) - f(t_0)}{t_1 - t_0}. \tag{1.7.1}
$$

The second-order divided differences are calculated using the first-order divided differences:

$$
f[t_0, t_1, t_2] = \frac{f[t_1, t_2] - f[t_0, t_1]}{t_2 - t_0}.
$$
Divided differences of \( m \)-th order are calculated using the divided differences of \((m-1)\)-th order

$$
f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = \frac{f[t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m] - f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}]}{t_m - t_0}.
$$  

(1.7.2)

Parameters \( t_i, i=0,1,\ldots,m \) are called knots. Divided differences are denoted by the symbol of the function upon which they were constructed, with the list of knots inside square brackets. The notation \([t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m]f\) is also used in the literature on divided differences. The order of the divided difference is one less than the number of knots in the square brackets. Zero-order divided differences are considered to be function values at the knots \( f(t_i) = f(t_i) \).

The divided difference of \( m \)-th order is expressed by the values of the function \( f(t) \) at the knots by the relation

$$
f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = \sum_{j=0}^{m} \frac{f(t_j)}{(t_j - t_0)(t_j - t_1) \ldots (t_j - t_{j-1})(t_j - t_{j+1}) \ldots (t_j - t_m)} = \sum_{j=0}^{m} W_{0,m}'(t_j),
$$

(1.7.3)

where \( W_{0,m}'(t_j) = (t_j - t_0)(t_j - t_1) \ldots (t_j - t_{j-1})(t_j - t_{j+1}) \ldots (t_j - t_m) \) is the derivative of the function \( W_{0,m}(t) = (t - t_0)(t - t_1) \ldots (t - t_{m-1})(t - t_m) \), calculated at \( t=t_j \). Indices in the function notation \( W_{0,m}(t) \) denote the numbers of the initial and the final knot. Equation (1.7.3) is proved by induction. For the first-order divided difference, the formula (1.7.3) is similar to (1.7.1); i.e., equality (1.7.3) holds for \( m=1 \). Let us assume that (1.7.3) holds for the divided differences of \((m-1)\)-th order and make sure that (1.7.3) holds for the divided differences of \( m \)-th order under this assumption. To do this, we find the difference of equalities

$$
f[t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m] = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \frac{(t_j - t_0)f(t_j)}{(t_j - t_0)W_{1,m}'(t_j)} \quad \text{and} \quad f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}] = \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \frac{(t_j - t_m)f(t_j)}{(t_j - t_m)W_{0,m-1}'(t_j)},
$$

where corresponding terms in the right-hand sides are reduced to a common denominator. As a result, we get

$$
f[t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m] - f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}] =
$$

$$
= \frac{(t_m - t_0)f(t_0)}{W_{0,m}'(t_0)} + \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \frac{(t_j - t_0)f(t_j) - (t_j - t_m)f(t_j)}{W_{0,m}'(t_j)} + \frac{(t_m - t_0)f(t_m)}{W_{0,m}'(t_m)} = (t_m - t_0) \sum_{j=0}^{m} \frac{f(t_j)}{W_{0,m}'(t_j)},
$$

which, after dividing by \((t_m - t_0)\) and considering (1.7.2), implies (1.7.3).

From equation (1.7.3) it can be seen that the divided difference does not depend on the order of knots \( t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m \) in the argument list.

Divided differences can be constructed on a sequence with coincident knots. Knots with coinciding values are called multiple knots. Thus if \( t_1 = t_2 = \ldots = t_k \), then we
say that the knot has multiplicity \( k \). If the first-order divided difference is constructed on multiple knots, it is equal to derivative of the function at this point

$$
f[t_i, t_i] = \lim_{t \to t_i} \frac{f(t) - f(t)}{t_i - t} = \left. \frac{df}{dt} \right|_{t_i} = f'(t_i).
$$

The \( m \)-th order divided difference constructed on a knot with multiplicity \( m+1 \) is equal to the \( m \)-th derivative of the function calculated at the given knot and divided by \( m! \)

$$
f[t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m] = \frac{1}{m!} \left. \frac{d^m f}{dt^m} \right|_{t_i} = \frac{f^{(m)}(t_i)}{m!}. \tag{1.7.4}
$$

If \( p(t) \) is an \( m \)-th degree polynomial of parameter \( t \) and we know the values of the polynomial \( p(t_i) \) at the knots \( t_i \), then the first-order divided difference

$$
p[t, t_i] = \frac{p(t_i) - p(t)}{t_i - t}
$$

is a polynomial of degree \((m-1)\). Indeed, the function \( p(t_i) - p(t) \) has a root \( t_i \) and therefore, according to the Bezout theorem, is exactly divisible by \( t_i - t \). The second-order divided difference

$$
p[t, t_1, t_2] = \frac{p[t_1, t_2] - p[t, t_1]}{t_2 - t}
$$

is a polynomial of degree \((m-2)\). Indeed, the function \( p[t_1, t_2] - p[t, t_1] \) has a root \( t_2 \) and therefore, according to Bezout theorem, is exactly divisible by \( t_2 - t \). Similar arguments lead to the fact that the divided difference of order \( m \) is a polynomial of degree zero

$$
p[t, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_m] = \text{const},
$$

and the \((m+1)\)-th order divided difference of an \( m \)-th degree polynomial is equal to zero:

$$
p[t, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{m+1}] = 0.
$$

Let \( p(t) \) be an interpolation polynomial of a function \( f(t) \) coinciding with it in \( m+1 \) knots \( t_i \), \( p(t_i) = f(t_i) \), \( i=0,1,\ldots,m \); then divided differences constructed on the knots \( t_i \) for the functions \( p(t) \) and \( f(t) \) are equal. From the definition of the divided difference for the function \( p(t) \) constructed on a sequence of knots \( t, t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m \),
$$ p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = \frac{p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}] - p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-2}]}{t_m - t} $$

and from equalities of the divided differences \( p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] \) follow equalities:

$$
\begin{align*}
p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}] &= f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] + (t - t_m)p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m], \\
p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-2}] &= f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}] + (t - t_{m-1})p[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}], \\
&\vdots \\
p[t_0, t_1] &= f[t_0, t_1] + (t - t_1)p[t_0, t_1], \\
p[t] &= f[t_0] + (t - t_0)p[t_0].
\end{align*}
$$

Since \( p(t) = p[t] \), we can substitute each of these equations in the preceding one, starting from the last equation. This yields the Newton interpolation formula for the function \( f(t) \)

$$
p(t) = f[t_0] + f[t_0, t_1](t - t_0) + \ldots + f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m](t - t_0)(t - t_1)\ldots(t - t_{m-1}). \tag{1.7.5}
$$

Thus, the coefficients of the Newton polynomial are corresponding divided differences of the interpolated function. If the interpolation (1.7.5) is performed over \( m+1 \) multiple knots \( t_0 = t_1 = \ldots = t_m \), then in accordance with (1.7.4), the divided differences are proportional to the derivative of the corresponding order of the interpolated functionâ€”and as a result we obtain a truncated Taylor series.

It is known that for a given set of values of the function \( f(t_i) \) at the knots \( t_i \), \( i=0,1,\ldots,m \), one can construct a unique polynomial of degree \( m \), coinciding at knots \( t_i \) with a given function. From the Newton interpolation formula (1.7.5), we see that the divided difference \( f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] \) of \( m \)-th order on a given sequence of \( m+1 \) knots is equal to the coefficient at the highest power of the argument \( t^m \) of the polynomial of degree \( m \), whose values at given knots are in agreement with the function \( f(t) \). This property can be taken as a definition of the divided difference.

**Property 1.** If \( f(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + \ldots + a_mt^m \) (polynomial of degree \( m \)), then

$$
f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = a_m, \quad f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}] = 0, \tag{1.7.6}
$$

for any additional knot \( t_{m+1} \).

**Property 2.** By the uniqueness of such polynomial and by (1.7.3) any divided difference is a symmetric function of its arguments; i.e., the value \( f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] \) does not depend on the order of the knots \( t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m \) in the argument list. The divided difference is expressed by the values of the function \( f(t) \) at the knots using the formula (1.7.3). If some knots are multiple, then the divided difference is expressed in terms of the values of the \( f(t) \) at simple knots and its derivatives at the multiple knots.

**Property 3.** If \( f(t) = k_g g(t) + k_h h(t) \), then
$$ f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = k_s g[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] + k_h h[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m]. $$

This equality follows from the uniqueness of the interpolation polynomial.

**Property 4.** If \( f(t) = g(t)h(t) \), then

$$
f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m] = \sum_{k=0}^{m} g[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_k] \cdot h[t_k, t_{k+1}, \ldots, t_m].
$$ (1.7.7)

To prove this formula we approximate each of the functions \( g(t) \) and \( h(t) \) by the polynomial (1.7.5), and multiply one by another. The coefficient at the highest degree \( t^m \) of the resulting polynomial is equal to the right-hand side of (1.7.7), as required. Equation (1.7.7) is called the **Leibniz formula**.

**Property 5.** If the polynomial \( p_{m-1}(t) \) of degree \( m-1 \) on the sequence of \( t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1} \) is constructed for the function \( f(t) \), then

$$
f(t) = p_{m-1}(t) + f[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m-1}, t](t-t_0)(t-t_1)\ldots(t-t_{m-1}).
$$

To derive this equality we consider \( t \) as an additional knot in the sequence of knots, and the equality is regarded as a necessary condition for a polynomial of degree \( m \) at an additional knot.

Consider a **truncated power function with shifted origin**

$$
\sigma_m(z) = (z-t)^m_+ = (\max(0, z-t))^m.
$$ (1.7.8)

Functions \( \sigma_m(z) \) are plotted in Fig. 1.7.1. The higher the degree of the function \( \sigma_m(z) \), the smoother it is at the point \( z=t \).

![Fig. 1.7.1.](image)

The parameter \( t \) determines the shift of the origin of the truncated power function. A truncated power function with a shifted origin is equal to zero at \( z \leq t \) and equal to \( (z-t)^m \) otherwise. The function \( \sigma_m(z) \) is continuous and piecewise monotonic at \( m>0 \); for \( m=0 \) it has a jump at \( z=t \), equal to unity. The function \( \sigma_m(z) \) has continuous derivatives up to order \( (m-1) \); the \( m \)-th order derivative has a discontinuity at \( z=t \). Function (1.7.8) is special because its derivatives are the same functions but with their degree reduced by one.

The divided differences \( \sigma_m[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}] \) of the truncated power function with shifted origin have properties that allow them to be used to construct rational curves.
The divided difference is calculated at a fixed parameter \( t \), but it is a function of the parameter \( t \). If all \( t_i < t \), \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, m+1 \), then all \( \sigma_m(t_i) = 0 \), and the divided difference \( \sigma_m[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}] \) is equal to zero. If all \( t_i > t \), \( i = 0, 1, \ldots, m+1 \), then the divided difference \( \sigma_m[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}] \) is equal to zero, since all knots are located on the segment, where the function is a polynomial of degree less than \((m+1)\). Only when the parameter \( t \) of the origin shift lies within the segment formed by the sequence of knots \( t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1} \) \((\min(t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}) \leq t \leq \max(t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}))\), the divided difference \( \sigma_m[t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+1}] \) of the truncated power function of degree \( m \) does not vanish.

### 1.8. B-Splines

\( B \)-splines are scalar functions with a set of useful properties. \( B \)-splines are constructed on divided differences and are used to construct curves. The fundamentals of \( B \)-spline theory were laid by J.C. Ferguson and I.J. Schoenberg. W.J. Gordon and R.F. Riesenfeld established a link between Bezier curves and \( B \)-splines, and showed that \( B \)-splines are generalizations of Bernstein functions. Bezier curves, rational curves (which in certain cases describe conic sections), and other curves can be based on \( B \)-splines.

A \( B \)-spline for a sequence of \( m+2 \) knots is the divided difference of \((m+1)\)-th order of the truncated power function with shifted origin of \( m \)-th degree multiplied by the difference between the maximum and minimum knot values of the sequence.

A \( B \)-spline constructed on a sequence of knots \( t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1} \) is defined by

$$
N^m_i(t) = (t_{\text{min}} - t_{\text{max}}) \sigma_m[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}],
$$

(1.8.1)

where \( t_{\text{max}} = \max(t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}) \), \( t_{\text{min}} = \min(t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}) \) are the maximum and minimum knot values of the sequence. Indices in \( B \)-spline notation are intended to characterize the sequence of knots constructed on which they are constructed, and may have different meanings in different publications. In some publications, the \( B \)-spline is ascribed an order equal to the degree of the truncated power function, while in others, \( B \)-spline has an order equal to the order of the divided difference. Furthermore, the \( B \)-spline is assigned to one of the knots of the sequence. We assume that the order of the \( B \)-spline is equal to the power of the function it is constructed on, and assign it to the first knot. Fig. 1.8.1 shows \( B \)-splines of zero, first and second order.

![Fig. 1.8.1](image-url)
Fig. 1.8.2 shows a B-spline of the third order $N_1^3(t) = (t_5 - t_1)\sigma_3[t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5]$ and a B-spline of the fifth order $N_5^5(t) = (t_9 - t_3)\sigma_5[t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6, t_7, t_8, t_9]$, constructed on equidistant knots.

If the sequence of knots a B-spline is constructed on contains multiple knots, then the derivatives of the B-spline lose their continuity. Fig. 1.8.3 shows B-splines of the third order with multiple knots $N_1^3(t) = (t_2 - t_1)\sigma_3[t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5]$, $N_3^3(t) = (t_5 - t_3)\sigma_3[t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6, t_7]$, $N_6^3(t) = (t_8 - t_6)\sigma_3[t_6, t_7, t_8]$. Index $m$ in (1.8.1) indicates the order of the B-spline and index $i$ points to the first knot in the sequence. The position of index $i$ before index $m$ indicates that the $i$-th knot is the first knot of the sequence. Later we will define B-spline $N_{m+i+m+1}(t)$, having an index of the last knot in the sequence, which will be indicated by positioning of the index $i+m+1$ after the index $m$. B-splines $N_i^m(t)$ and $N_{m+i+m+1}(t)$ constructed on the same sequence of knots are identical.

To calculate B-splines, divided differences of the truncated exponential function called unnormalized B-splines are introduced.

An unnormalized B-spline for a sequence of $m+2$ knots is the divided difference of the $(m+1)$-th order of the truncated power function with shifted origin of $m$-th degree.

An unnormalized B-spline constructed on a sequence of knots $t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}$ is defined by

$$M_i^m(t) = \sigma_m[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}].$$  \hspace{1cm} (1.8.2)

In the notation for unnormalized B-splines in (1.8.2), index $i$ indicates the first knot of the sequence, and index $m$ indicates the order of the B-spline.
A B-spline and an unnormalized B-spline are linked by a coefficient, and except for a factor, have the same definition. Calculation of B-splines is performed with the help of unnormalized B-splines.

Suppose there is a sequence of \( m+2 \) knots \( t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1} \), where at least two have distinct values. Suppose that \( t_i \neq t_{i+m+1} \). Let us use the Leibniz formula (1.7.7) to calculate the B-spline. We represent the function \( \sigma_m(z) = (z-t)^m \) as a product \( \sigma_m(z) = g(z)\sigma_{m-1}(z) \), where \( \sigma_{m-1}(z) = (z-t)^{m-1} \) and \( g(z) = (z-t) \). Then the divided difference is

$$
\sigma_m[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] = g[t_i]\sigma_{m-1}[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] + g[t_i, t_{i+1}]\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] + \cdots + 0 = \\
= (t_i - t)\sigma_{m-1}[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] + \sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}].
$$

(1.8.3)

In (1.8.3) we used the fact that the divided differences of higher orders for the function \( g(z) \) are equal to zero. We substitute \( \sigma_{m-1}[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] \) in (1.8.3) by the definition of divided difference (1.7.2)

$$
\sigma_{m-1}[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] = \frac{\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] - \sigma_{m-1}[t_{i}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m}]}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}
$$

and get

$$
\sigma_m[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] =
\frac{t_i - t}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}(\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] - \sigma_{m-1}[t_{i}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m}]) + \frac{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] =
\frac{t_{i+m+1} - t}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] + \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m}].
$$

(1.8.4)

Let us rewrite (1.8.4) using the definition of an unnormalized B-spline in (1.8.2) to obtain the formula

$$
M_i^m(t) = \frac{t_{i+m+1} - t}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}M_{i+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}M_i^{m-1}(t).
$$

(1.8.5)

The recurrence relation (1.8.5) was obtained independently by Mansfield, M.G. Cox and C. De Boor, and is called the Cox-De Boor formula. This relation is central to the theory of B-splines. It encourages us to forget about divided differences and to define the B-spline of \( m \)-th order for a sequence of \( m+2 \) knots \( t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1} \) as a function computed by the recurrence relation (1.8.5) with initial values

$$
M_i^0(t) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{|t_{i+1} - t_i|}, & \text{if } \min(t_i, t_{i+1}) \leq t < \max(t_i, t_{i+1}), \\
0, & \text{in other cases}.
\end{cases}
$$

(1.8.6)
Equation (1.8.6) expresses an unnormalized B-spline of order zero by the divided difference of the first order for the function \( \sigma_0(z) = (z - t)^0_+ \).

Let's forget for a moment about indexing in formula (1.8.5) and consider the function, using its barycentric coordinates. Suppose we are given an arbitrary sequence of \( m+2 \) knots, in which at least two knots have distinct values. Recall that the divided difference does not depend on the order of the knots in the argument list. We choose two arbitrary not-coinciding knots, \( t_a \) and \( t_b \), from the sequence of \( m+2 \) knots. Let us introduce barycentric coordinates on the basis of these two knots:

$$
a(t) = \frac{t_b - t}{t_b - t_a}, \quad b(t) = \frac{t_a - t}{t_a - t_b}.
$$

We introduce the following notations. A sequence of \( m+2 \) knots \( t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1} \) is denoted as \( T \). The sequence of \( m+1 \) knots obtained from \( T \) by removing the knot \( t_a \) is denoted as \( T \setminus a \). The sequence of \( m+1 \) knots obtained from \( T \) by removing the knot \( t_b \) is denoted as \( T \setminus b \). The \((m+1)\)-th order divided difference of the truncated power function \((z - t)^m_+\) on the sequence of knots \( T \) is denoted as \( M^T(t) \). The \( m \)-th order divided difference of the truncated power function \((z - t)^{m-1}_+\) on the sequence of knots \( T \setminus a \) is denoted as \( M^{T \setminus a}(t) \). The \( m \)-th order divided difference of the truncated power function \((z - t)^{m-1}_+\) on the set of knots \( T \setminus b \) is denoted as \( M^{T \setminus b}(t) \). Then the Cox-De Boor formula (1.8.5) for unnormalized B-splines on the sequence of knots \( T \) takes the form

$$
M^T(t) = a(t)M^{T \setminus a}(t) + b(t)M^{T \setminus b}(t).
$$  

(1.8.7)

Since the divided difference is a symmetric function of its arguments, the last recurrence relation does not depend on the choice of the knots \( t_a \) and \( t_b \). Recurrence relation (1.8.7) starts with evaluation of unnormalized B-splines of order zero (1.8.6).

For a visual representation of (1.8.5) we assume that the knots of the sequence are arranged in ascending order of their value: \( t_i \leq t_{i+1} \leq \ldots \leq t_{i+m+1} \). Then one of the two B-splines of \((m-1)\)-th order will be adjacent to the start point of the calculated B-spline, and the otherâ€”to the endpoint of the calculated B-spline; see Fig. 1.8.4. Each of the two \((m-1)\)-th order B-splines is multiplied by a factor proportional to parameter \( t \), the distance from the end knot of the given sequence to which the \((m-1)\)-th order B-spline adjoins. The sum of these two coefficients \( a(t), b(t) \) is equal to one.

![Fig. 1.8.4](image-url)
With the help of B-splines, we can construct curves based on points whose B-spline binding-knot index is equal to the index of the point. Therefore, a non-decreasing sequence of knots is used to construct curves, because the knots are related to the curve parameter. In addition, the family of B-splines constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of knots for a given parameter \( t \) has certain properties. Thus, in practice, B-splines are constructed on knots that belong to a part of the total sequence of knots arranged in sequential order.

**Property 1.** Let B-spline \( N_i^m(t) \) be constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of \( m+2 \) knots \( t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1} \). Then the B-spline \( N_i^m(t) \) is nonzero only in the region \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+m+1} \) and \( N_i^m(t) = 0 \) for \( t < t_i \) and \( t > t_{i+m+1} \). Indeed, once \( t < t_i \), the truncated function becomes \( \sigma_m(z) = (z-t)^m \) between points \( t_i \) and \( t_{i+m+1} \), and considering that \( (z-t)^m \) is a polynomial of degree less than \( m+1 \), any \((m+1)\)-th-order divided difference constructed on this polynomial is zero. Once \( t > t_{i+m+1} \), the divided difference is equal to zero due to the fact that \( \sigma_m(z) = 0 \) between the knots \( t_i \) and \( t_{i+m+1} \). Only when \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+m+1} \), the divided difference \( \sigma_m[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] \) is nonzero. Thus, B-splines are local functions taking nonzero values on the interval containing the constructing knots of the B-spline.

**Property 2.** \( N_i^m(t) \geq 0 \) â€” that is, B-splines take non-negative values for any values of the parameter. This follows from the above properties and the recurrence relation (1.8.5) for the non-decreasing sequence of knots.

**Property 3.** Suppose we are given an infinite (or long enough) non-decreasing sequence of knots \( t_i \) and on every \((m+2)\) knots of the sequence an \( m \)-th order B-spline is constructed. We can show that for any \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \), only \( m+1 \) B-splines are nonzeroâ€”namely, \( N_{i-m}^m(t), N_{i+1-m}^m(t), \ldots, N_i^m(t) \), and their sum is equal to 1. Indeed, all B-splines \( N_j^m(t) \), where \( j < i-m \), are equal to zero, as they were constructed on knots where \( \sigma_m(z) = 0 \); all B-splines \( N_j^m(t) \), where \( j \geq i+1 \), are equal to zero, as they were constructed on knots where \( \sigma_m(z) = (z-t)^m \) is a polynomial of degree less than \( m+1 \).

Thus, the sum of all B-splines with \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \) depends on the final number of B-splines:

$$
\sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m(t) = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m(t).
$$

(1.8.8)

If we use the definition of divided difference (1.7.2), then the B-spline (1.8.1) can be written as

$$
N_j^m(t) = \sigma_m[t_{j+1}, t_{j+2}, \ldots, t_{j+m+1}] - \sigma_m[t_j, t_{j+1}, \ldots, t_{j+m}].
$$

(1.8.9)

Using (1.8.8) and (1.8.9), we find the sum of all B-splines with \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \).
$$ \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m(t) = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} (\sigma_m[t_{j+1}, t_{j+2}, \ldots, t_{j+m+1}] - \sigma_m[t_j, t_{j+1}, \ldots, t_{j+m}]) = $$
$$ = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} \sigma_m[t_{j+1}, t_{j+2}, \ldots, t_{j+m+1}] - \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} \sigma_m[t_j, t_{j+1}, \ldots, t_{j+m}] = $$
$$ = \sigma_m[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] - \sigma_m[t_{i-m}, t_{i+1-m}, \ldots, t_i] = 1 - 0 = 1. \quad (1.8.10) $$

In (1.8.10) we used \( \sigma_m[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] = 1 \) as the coefficient at the highest power of the argument in the polynomial \((z-t)^m\) describing the truncated power function on an open interval \(t_{i+1} < z < t_{i+m+1}\). In addition, the truncated power function is zero on the interval \(t_{i-m} < z < t_i\) and hence its divided difference \( \sigma_m[t_{i-m}, t_{i+1-m}, \ldots, t_i] = 0 \). Since the segment \(t_i \leq t < t_{i+1}\) was chosen arbitrarily, a similar equation holds for any other segment. Thus, for any \(t\), the sum of all B-splines is subject to the equality

$$ \sum_j N_j^m(t) = 1. \quad (1.8.11) $$

Relation (1.8.11) for the B-splines is analogous to relation (1.4.3) for the Bernstein basis. Thus, the family of all nonzero functions \(N_j^m(t)\) is a partition of unity for any fixed parameter \(t\).

**Property 4.** For a non-decreasing sequence of knots \(t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}\), a B-spline is computed using the recurrence relation

$$ N_i^m(t) = \frac{t_{i+m+1} - t}{t_{i+m+1} - t_{i+1}} N_{i+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+m} - t_i} N_i^{m-1}(t), \quad (1.8.12) $$

starting with the order-zero B-spline

$$ N_j^0(t) = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } t_j \leq t < t_{j+1} \\ 0, & \text{in other cases} \end{cases}. \quad (1.8.13) $$

Equation (1.8.12) follows from the Cox-De Boor recurrence formula (1.8.5), one just need to substitute the relations between B-splines and corresponding unnormalized B-splines

$$ N_i^m(t) = (t_{i+m+1} - t_i) M_i^m(t). \quad (1.8.14) $$

**Property 5.** The derivative of an order-\(m\) B-spline is expressed by B-splines of order \((m-1)\). To prove this, we differentiate a B-spline constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of knots \(t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}\) and represented as (1.8.9):
$$ \frac{dN_i^m(t)}{dt} = \frac{d\sigma_m[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}]}{dt} - \frac{d\sigma_m[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m}]}{dt}. $$

If we substitute \( t \)-derivatives of a truncated power function in the last expression

$$ \frac{d\sigma_m}{dt} = -m(z-t)^{m-1}_+ = -m\sigma_{m-1}, $$

we get

$$ \frac{dN_i^m(t)}{dt} = -m\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i+1}, t_{i+2}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1}] + m\sigma_{m-1}[t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m}] = $$
$$ = -mM_{i+1}^{m-1}(t) + mM_i^{m-1}(t) = $$
$$ = -\frac{m}{t_{i+m+1} - t_{i+1}} N_{i+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{m}{t_{i+m} - t_i} N_i^{m-1}(t). $$ (1.8.15)

Similarly, we obtain that the derivative of a non-normalized \( B \)-spline of order \( m \) is expressed by unnormalized \( B \)-splines of \((m-1)\)-th order by the formula

$$ \frac{dM_i^m(t)}{dt} = m \frac{M_i^{m-1}(t) - M_{i+1}^{m-1}(t)}{t_{i+m+1} - t_i}. $$

**Property 6.** Let a \( B \)-spline be constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of knots \( t_i, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_{i+m+1} \). From equation (1.8.12) and equation (1.8.15), it follows that the \( B \)-spline of order \( m \) is an \( m \)-times differentiable function. In the absence of multiple knots, the \( B \)-spline and its derivatives up to order \((m-1)\) order are continuous functions and are equal to zero at \( t=t_i \) and \( t=t_{i+m+1} \).

**Property 7.** The area under any unnormalized \( B \)-spline satisfies the following equality

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} M_i^m(t) dt = \int_{t_{\min}}^{t_{\max}} M_i^m(t) dt = \frac{1}{m+1}, $$ (1.8.16)

where \( t_{\max} \) and \( t_{\min} \) are the maximum and minimum knot values of the sequence used to evaluate the \( B \)-spline. We obtain the equation (1.8.16) by integrating the truncated power function (1.7.8) within the specified limits

$$ \int_{t_{\min}}^{t_{\max}} (z-t)^m_+ dt = \frac{1}{m+1} (z-t_{\min})^{m+1}_+ - \frac{1}{m+1} (z-t_{\max})^{m+1}_+ $$

and calculating the \((m+1)\)-order divided difference of the obtained function on the sequence of \( B \)-spline knots. The second term on the right-hand side is equal to zero in
the range \( t_{\text{min}} \leq z \leq t_{\text{max}} \) and the first term is an \((m+1)\)-th-degree polynomial. In accordance with (1.7.6), the order-(\(m+1\))-divided difference of this polynomial is equal to the coefficient at \(z^{m+1}\)â€”i.e., is equal to \(1/(m+1)\), which proves (1.8.16).

From (1.8.16) follows the equality

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} N_i^m(t) dt = (t_{\text{max}} - t_{\text{min}}) \int_{t_{\text{min}}}^{t_{\text{max}}} M_i^m(t) dt = \frac{t_{\text{max}} - t_{\text{min}}}{m + 1},
$$

which is used to calculate the area under B-spline.

### 1.9. B-Spline Curves

The foundations of B-spline curve theory were laid by S.A. Coons and C. De Boor. K.J. Versprille developed the theory of B-spline curves further and used it in engineering.

Construct a non-uniform rational curve based on B-splines \(N_j^m(t)\) on the control points \(p_j\) having weights \(w_j, j=0,1,...,n\) (\(n \geq m\)). Calculate the radius vector of the curve using the formula

$$
r(t) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t) w_j p_j}{\sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t) w_j}.

(1.9.1)

Each of the \(m\)-th-order B-splines \(N_j^m(t)\) is constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of \(m+2\) knots \(t_0, t_1, ..., t_{n+m+1}\). In the general case, the curve (1.9.1) is non-uniform and rational. The non-uniformity of the curve suggests that its knots are not evenly spaced, and its rationality indicates the presence of the weights of the control points, which results in the presence of the denominator in (1.9.1). Curve (1.9.1) is called a **NURBS** curve or **B-spline curve**. "NURBS" stands for "Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline."

When all the control points of curve (1.9.1) have equal weights, then by (1.8.11), the radius vector of the B-spline curve is calculated by the formula

$$
r(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t) p_j.
$$  

(1.9.2)

Formula (1.9.1) has the same form in terms of homogeneous coordinates (1.6.3):

$$
R(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t) P_j.
$$
Construction of the family of the $n+1$ $m$-th-order B-splines of an open B-spline curve requires $n+m+2$ knots. The sequence of knots $t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+n+2}$ a B-spline curve is constructed on is called a knot vector. The shape of a B-spline curve depends not only on the location of its control points, but also on the knot values. In order to demonstrate the dependence of the curve shape on the knot values, we construct two B-spline curves of the same order on the same control points, but with different knot vectors.

Fig. 1.9.1 shows two B-curves and a polyline constructed on the same control points. The cubic B-spline curve with knot vector 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is indicated in Fig. 1.9.1 by a solid line. The cubic B-spline curve with knot vector 0, 1, 11, 12, 22, 23, 33, 34, 44, 45, 55 is shown in Fig. 1.9.1 by a dashed line. Two different non-decreasing sequences of eleven numbers were taken as knot vectors. A polyline constructed on the control points of the B-spline curve is shown in Fig. 1.9.1 as a thin line.

Fig. 1.9.2 shows a cubic B-spline curve constructed on control points similar to those used for the B-spline curve shown in Fig. 1.9.1. But this time, the knot vector is 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4. The B-spline curve shown in Fig. 1.9.2 has multiple knots at both ends of the knot vector and therefore passes through its end control points. To make an open curve pass through its first and last control point, the first B-spline should have the first $m+1$ of the $m+2$ knots upon which it is constructed be multiple, and the last B-spline should have the last $m+1$ of the $m+2$ knots upon which it is constructed be multiple. That is, for an open B-spline curve passing through its endpoints, the following equalities should be satisfied: $t_0 = t_1 = \ldots = t_m$ and $t_{n+1} = t_{n+2} = \ldots = t_{n+m+1}$. The parameter of a B-spline curve varies from knot value $t_{\text{min}} = t_m$ to knot value $t_{\text{max}} = t_{n+1}$.

The construction of a family of $n+1$ $m$-th order B-splines of a periodic closed B-spline curve requires $n+2m+2$ knots (the knot vector must be extended by $m$ knots).
The sequence of knots should reflect the closedness: The first $2m$ knots must be separated by intervals similar to the intervals separating the last $2m$ knots. That is, for a closed B-spline curve, equalities $t_1 - t_0 = t_{n+2} - t_{n+1}$, $t_2 - t_1 = t_{n+3} - t_{n+2}$, ..., $t_{2m+1} - t_{2m} = t_{n+2m+2} - t_{n+2m+1}$ must be satisfied. Fig. 1.9.3 shows a periodic closed cubic B-spline curve with knot vector $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11$ and a polyline constructed on eight control points of the B-spline curve.

![Fig. 1.9.3.](image)

The parameter of periodic closed B-spline curves varies from knot value $t_{\text{min}} = t_m$ to knot value $t_{\text{max}} = t_{n+m+1}$. The number of knots of a B-spline curve is always greater than the number of its control points; thatâ€™s why the knot vector is called an extended knot vector.

B-spline curves constructed on knot vectors that do not have multiple knots, or have them only at the beginning and at the end of the knot vector (for open curves), have continuous derivatives up to order $(m-1)$ over the entire domain. If a knot vector contains multiple knots in places other than the boundary, then the continuity of the corresponding curve derivatives is broken.

In accordance with the Cox-De Boor formula (1.8.5), the scheme for calculating one B-spline $N_j^m(t)$ formally looks like (the order of the B-spline increases from top to bottom, and knot numbers increase from left to right):

$$
\begin{align*}
N_j^0(t) & \quad N_{j+1}^0(t) & \ldots & \quad N_{j+m-2}^0(t) & \quad N_{j+m-1}^0(t) & \quad N_{j+m}^0(t) \\
N_j^1(t) & \quad N_{j+1}^1(t) & \ldots & \quad N_{j+m-2}^1(t) & \quad N_{j+m-1}^1(t) \\
N_j^2(t) & \quad N_{j+1}^2(t) & \ldots & \quad N_{j+m-2}^2(t) \\
\vdots & \quad \vdots & \ddots & \quad \vdots \\
N_j^{m-1}(t) & \quad N_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) \\
N_j^m(t)
\end{align*}
$$

Among all B-splines of nonzero order (1.8.13), only one is nonzero for any value of parameter $t$. Therefore, to calculate the radius vector of the B-spline curve, the following scheme is used. Using the parameter value $t$ and conditions $t_i \leq t < t_{i+1}$, the number $i$ of nonzero B-splines of order zero is determined, and the value of unnormalized B-spline curve is calculated:
$$ M_i^0(t) = \frac{1}{t_{i+1} - t_i}. $$  
(1.9.3)

Then, using the recurrence Cox-De Boor relation,

$$ M_j^m(t) = \frac{t_{j+m+1} - t}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1} - t_i} M_j^{m-1}(t), $$  
(1.9.4)

all unnormalized B-splines nonzero at a given parameter \( t \) are consequently computed up to \( m \)-th order (the B-spline order increases downwards, and knot numbers increase from left to right):

$$
\begin{array}{cccc}
M_i^0(t) & M_{i-1}^1(t) & M_i^1(t) \\
M_{i-2}^2(t) & M_{i-1}^2(t) & M_i^2(t) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
M_{i-m+1}^{m-i}(t) & \cdots & M_{i-1}^{m-1}(t) & M_i^{m-1}(t) \\
M_{i-m}^m(t) & M_{i-m+1}^m(t) & \cdots & M_{i-1}^m(t) & M_i^m(t)
\end{array}
$$

This triangular table is calculated line by line, because the first-row element is known from (1.9.3), and each element of the next row can be constructed from two adjacent elements of the previous row using (1.9.4). When calculating the outer elements of each row, we use the fact that one of the elements in the previous row (missing in the table) is equal to zero. After this, B-splines are normalized

$$ N_j^m(t) = (t_{j+m+1} - t_j) M_j^m(t), \quad j = i - m, i - m + 1, \ldots, i $$

and substituted into the formula (1.9.1), which for \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \) takes the form

$$ r(t) = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m(t) w_j p_j \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m(t) w_j. $$

Using the relations (1.58), we can carry out simultaneous calculation of the B-splines and their derivatives. This calculation is used in iterative processes of intersection of curves.

Suppose for the parametric value \( t \), the number \( i \) of knot \( t_i \) is determined from the condition \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \). Nonzero B-splines at a given parameter value \( t \) are: \( N_{i-m}^m(t), \)
Let us differentiate the numerator of the right-hand side of (1.9.1), taking into account (1.8.15). We obtain

$$
\frac{d(\text{wr})}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m w_j p_j \right) = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} \frac{dN_j^m}{dt} w_j p_j =
$$

$$
m \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^{m-1} \frac{w_j p_j}{t_{j+m} - t_j} - m \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} \frac{w_j p_j}{t_{j+m+1} - t_{j+1}} =
$$

$$
= mN_{i-m}^{m-1} \frac{w_{i-m} p_{i-m}}{t_i - t_{i-m}} + m \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} \frac{w_j p_j}{t_{j+m} - t_j} -
$$

$$
- mN_{i+1}^{m-1} \frac{w_{i+1} p_{i+1}}{t_{i+1} - t_{i+1}} - m \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} \frac{w_j p_j}{t_{j+m} - t_j} =
$$

$$
= m \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} \frac{w_j p_j - w_{j-1} p_{j-1}}{t_{j+m} - t_j} = \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} p_j^{(1)}, \tag{1.9.5}
$$

where the following notation is introduced

$$
p_j^{(1)} = m \frac{w_j p_j - w_{j-1} p_{j-1}}{t_{j+m} - t_j}, \quad j = 1,2,...,n.
$$

In equation (1.9.5) we used the properties \( N_{i-m}^{m-1}(t) = 0 \) and \( N_{i+1}^{m-1}(t) = 0 \) for \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \). Equation (1.9.5) shows that the first derivative of the function \( \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m w_j p_j \) is a function similar to \( \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} p_j^{(1)} \), with the order and number of terms less by one. Continuing the differentiation, we can find the derivative of the desired order for the numerator of the expression (1.9.1)

$$
\frac{d^k(\text{wr})}{dt^k} = \frac{d^k}{dt^k} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m w_j p_j \right) = \sum_{j=k}^{n} N_j^{m-k} p_j^{(k)}, \tag{1.9.6}
$$

where \( p_j^{(k)} = (m + 1 - k) \frac{p_j^{(k-1)} - p_{j-1}^{(k-1)}}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j}, \quad k = 1,2,...,m, \quad j = k,k+1,...,n, \)

\( p_j^{(0)} = w_j p_j \). For the derivatives of the denominator (1.9.1) we get an expression similar to (1.9.6),

$$
\frac{d^k w}{dt^k} = \frac{d^k}{dt^k} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m w_j \right) = \sum_{j=k}^{n} N_j^{m-k} w_j^{(k)}, \tag{1.9.7}
$$
where \( w_j^{(k)} = (m + 1 - k) \frac{w_j^{(k-1)} - w_{j-1}^{(k-1)}}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j}, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots, m, \quad j = k, k + 1, \ldots, n, \)

\( w_j^{(0)} = w_j. \)

The radius vector of a B-spline curve (1.9.1) is calculated as a quotient of two functions of the curve parameter \( t \). So when we calculate the derivative of a B-spline curve, the right-hand side of (1.9.1) should be considered as a composite function, the first derivative of which is equal to

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\mathbf{wr}}{w} \right) = \frac{1}{w} \frac{d(\mathbf{wr})}{dt} - \frac{\mathbf{wr}}{w^2} \frac{dw}{dt},
$$

(1.9.8)

where

\( \mathbf{wr} = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t) w_j p_j \) â€“ numerator of the right-hand side of (1.9.1),

\( w = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t) w_j \) â€“ denominator of the right-hand side of (1.9.1),

\( \frac{d(\mathbf{wr})}{dt} = m \sum_{j=1}^{n} N_j^{m-1}(t) \frac{w_j p_j - w_{j-1} p_{j-1}}{t_{j+m} - t_j} \) â€“ derivative of the numerator,

\( \frac{dw}{dt} = m \sum_{j=1}^{n} N_j^{m-1}(t) \frac{w_j - w_{j-1}}{t_{j+m} - t_j} \) â€“ derivative of the denominator.

In the same manner we calculate higher-order derivatives of the B-spline curve:

$$
\frac{d^{(k)}\mathbf{r}}{dt^{(k)}} = \frac{d^{(k)}}{dt^{(k)}} \left( \frac{\mathbf{wr}(t)}{w(t)} \right).
$$

It should be noted that the radius vector of a point and its weight (\( \mathbf{wr} \) or \( w_j p_j \)) in the formulas for the B-spline curve appear as a single entity.

### 1.10. De Boorâ€™s Algorithm

Let us use formula (1.8.12) to transform the numerator of expression (1.9.1) as follows:

$$
\mathbf{wr}(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m w_j p_j = \sum_{j=-m}^{i} N_j^m w_j p_j =
$$

$$
= \sum_{j=-m}^{i} \left( \frac{t_{j+m+1} - t}{t_{j+m+1} - t_{j+i}} N_{j+1}^{m-1} + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m} - t_j} N_j^{m-1} \right) w_j p_j =
$$
where we introduce the notation

$$ r_j^{(1)} = \frac{t_{j+m} - t}{t_{j+m} - t_j} w_{j-1} p_{j-1} + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m} - t_j} w_j p_j. $$

In (1.10.1) we use the fact that for \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \) only \( N_{i-m}^m(t), N_{i-m+1}^m(t), \ldots, N_i^m(t) \) are nonzero, and also use equalities \( N_{i-m}^{m-1}(t) = 0 \) and \( N_i^{m-1}(t) = 0 \). We reduce the sum of \( m+1 \) terms to a sum of \( m \) terms and lower the order of the B-splines in this sum by one. To further simplify the numerator of (1.9.1) in a similar way, we obtain

$$ wr(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m w_j p_j = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m w_j p_j = \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} r_j^{(1)} = \sum_{j=i-m+2}^{i} N_j^{m-2} r_j^{(2)} = \ldots = \sum_{j=i-m+m}^{i} N_j^0(t) r_j^{(m)} = r_i^{(m)}, \quad (1.10.2) $$

where we introduce the notation \( r_j^{(0)} = w_j p_j, \quad r_j^{(k)} = \frac{t_{j+m+1-k} - t}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} r_{j-1}^{(k-1)} + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} r_j^{(k-1)}, \)

for \( k \) ranging from 1 to \( m \). We obtain a similar expression for the denominator of (1.9.1)

$$ w(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m w_j = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m w_j = \sum_{j=i-m+1}^{i} N_j^{m-1} w_j^{(1)} = \sum_{j=i-m+2}^{i} N_j^{m-2} w_j^{(2)} = \ldots = \sum_{j=i-m+m}^{i} N_j^0(t) w_j^{(m)} = w_i^{(m)}, \quad (1.10.3) $$

where we introduce the notation \( w_j^{(0)} = w_j, \quad w_j^{(k)} = \frac{t_{j+m+1-k} - t}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} w_{j-1}^{(k-1)} + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} w_j^{(k-1)}, \)

for \( k \) changing from 1 to \( m \).

We concluded that the position of the point of the B-spline curve (1.9.1) for a given parameter \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \) can be determined by the formula
$$ r(t) = \frac{w_r(t)}{w(t)} = \frac{r_i^{(m)}}{w_i^{(m)}} $$  

(1.10.4)

using recurrence relations

$$
\begin{align*}
    r_j^{(k)} &= \frac{t_{j+m+1-k} - t}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} r_{j-1}^{(k-1)} + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} r_j^{(k-1)}, \\
    w_j^{(k)} &= \frac{t_{j+m+1-k} - t}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} w_{j-1}^{(k-1)} + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1-k} - t_j} w_j^{(k-1)},
\end{align*}
$$

starting with values \( r_j^{(0)} = w_j p_j, \; w_j^{(0)} = w_j \). These relations are generalization of De Casteljauâ€™s algorithm, and are called De Boorâ€™s algorithm.

An algorithm for calculating the radius vector of the point of the B-spline curve for parameter \( t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \) is illustrated in Fig. 1.10.1.

### 1.11. Point and Knot Insertion in a B-Spline Curve

The number of knots and control points of a B-spline curve can be increased, while keeping the shape and parametric length of the curve the same. Let us insert an additional knot \( v \) into a sequence of knots \( t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_{m+n+2} \) of the curve (1.9.2).

Let the value \( v \) satisfy the conditions \( t_{\min} < v < t_{\max} \) and let it not coincide with any of the knots of the \( m \)-th-order B-spline curve. We can find the number \( i \) of the knot \( t_i \) from the condition \( t_i \leq v < t_{i+1} \) and construct the sequence of knots \( v_0 = t_0, \; v_1 = t_1, \ldots, \; v_i = t_i, \)
The new curve must have the number of its knots and control points increased by one. The radius vector of the new curve is described by the formula

$$ r(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n+1} N_j^m(t) q_j. $$

The B-splines of the new curve are denoted by the underlined symbols. Because of knot values the following equalities will hold:

$$
N_j^m(t) = \underline{N}_j^m(t), \quad j = 0, 1, \ldots, i - m - 1,
$$
$$
N_j^m(t) = \underline{N}_{j+1}^m(t), \quad j = i + 1, i + 2, \ldots, n,
$$
$$
N_j^m(t) = \frac{v_{j+m+2} - v}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} \underline{N}_{j+1}^m(t) + \frac{v - v_j}{v_{j+m+1} - v_j} \underline{N}_j^m(t), \quad j = i - m, i - m + 1, \ldots, i.
$$

For unnormalized B-splines the last equation has the form

$$
M_j^m(t) = \frac{v_{j+m+2} - v}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} M_{j+1}^m(t) + \frac{v - v_j}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} M_j^m(t), \quad j = i - m, i - m + 1, \ldots, i. \tag{1.11.1}
$$

Equation (1.11.1) is proved by induction. Direct substitution shows that equality (1.11.1) holds for unnormalized B-spline curves of order zero:

$$
\frac{1}{t_{i+1} - t_i} = \frac{v_{i+2} - v}{v_{i+2} - v_i} \frac{1}{v_{i+2} - v_{i+1}}.
$$

Suppose that (1.11.1) holds for unnormalized B-splines of order \((m-1)\). We need to make sure that it also holds for an unnormalized order-\(m\) B-spline under this assumption. To do this we substitute (1.11.1) for \(M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t)\) and \(M_j^{m-1}(t)\) in (1.8.5) and obtain

$$
M_j^m(t) = \frac{t_{j+m+1} - t}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} \left( \frac{v_{j+m+2} - v}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} M_{j+2}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{v - v_j}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) \right) +
\frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} \left( \frac{v_{j+m+1} - v}{v_{j+m+1} - v_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{v - v_j}{v_{j+m+1} - v_j} M_j^{m-1}(t) \right) =
\frac{t_{j+m+1} - t}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} \frac{v_{j+m+2} - v}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} M_{j+2}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} \frac{v_{j+m+1} - v}{v_{j+m+1} - v_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) +
\frac{t_{j+m+1} - t}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} \frac{v - v_j}{v_{j+m+2} - v_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+m+1} - t_j} \frac{v - v_j}{v_{j+m+1} - v_j} M_j^{m-1}(t).
$$

In the second and the third terms, we make the substitution using the equality
$$
\frac{(t-t_j)(v_{j+m+1}-v)}{v_{j+m+1}-v_j} + \frac{(t_{j+m+1}-t)(v-v_{j+1})}{v_{j+m+2}-v_{j+1}} = \frac{(v_{j+m+2}-v)(t-v_{j+1})}{v_{j+m+2}-v_{j+1}} + \frac{(v-v_j)(v_{j+m+1}-t)}{v_{j+m+1}-v_j},
$$

which can be verified by direct calculation. After substitution we get:

$$
M_j^m(t) = \frac{v_{j+m+2}-v}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{v_{j+m+2}-v}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} \frac{t-v_{j+1}}{v_{j+m+2}-v_{j+1}} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) +
\frac{v-v_j}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} \frac{v_{j+m+1}-t}{v_{j+m+1}-v_j} M_{j+1}^{m-1}(t) + \frac{v-v_j}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} \frac{t-v_j}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} M_j^{m-1}(t) =
\frac{v_{j+m+2}-v}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} M_{j+1}^{m}(t) + \frac{v-v_j}{v_{j+m+2}-v_j} M_j^{m}(t),
$$

which completes the proof.

For the new curve, we must have

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{n} N_j^m(t)p_j = \sum_{j=0}^{n+1} N_j^m(t)q_j.
$$

From independence of B-splines, we obtain equalities

$$
p_j = q_j, \quad j = 0, 1, \ldots, i-m-1,
$$
$$
p_j = q_{j+1}, \quad j = i+1, i+2, \ldots, n,
$$
$$
\sum_{j=i-m}^{i} N_j^m(t)p_j = \sum_{j=i-m}^{i+1} N_j^m(t)q_j.
$$

Let us insert the expression for a B-spline of the curve (1.9.2) in terms of the B-spline of the new curve into the last equality

$$
\left( \frac{v_{i+2}-v}{v_{i+2}-v_{i-m+1}} N_{i-m+1}^m(t) + \frac{v-v_{i-m}}{v_{i+1}-v_{i-m}} N_{i-m}^m(t) \right) p_{i-m} +
\left( \frac{v_{i+3}-v}{v_{i+3}-v_{i-m+2}} N_{i-m+2}^m(t) + \frac{v-v_{i-m+1}}{v_{i+2}-v_{i-m+1}} N_{i-m+1}^m(t) \right) p_{i-m+1} +
\ldots +
\left( \frac{v_{i+m+2}-v}{v_{i+m+2}-v_{i+1}} N_{i+1}^m(t) + \frac{v-v_i}{v_{i+m+1}-v_i} N_i^m(t) \right) p_i =
N_{i-m}^m(t)q_{i-m} + N_{i-m+1}^m(t)q_{i-m+1} + \ldots + N_i^m(t)q_i + N_{i+1}^m(t)q_{i+1}.
$$

After regrouping terms, we obtain
$$ N_{i-m}^m(t)(q_{i-m} - p_{i-m}) + N_{i-m+1}^m(t)\left( q_{i-m+1} - \frac{v-t_{i-m+1}}{t_{i+1}-t_{i-m+1}}p_{i-m+1} - \frac{t_{i+1}-v}{t_{i+1}-t_{i-m+1}}p_{i-m} \right) + \ldots + N_i^m(t)\left( q_i - \frac{v-t_i}{t_{i+m}-t_i}p_i - \frac{t_{i+m}-v}{t_{i+m}-t_i}p_{i-1} \right) + N_{i+1}^m(t)(q_{i+1} - p_i) = 0. $$

We now introduce the notation \( \alpha_j = \frac{v-t_j}{t_{j+m}-t_j} \) for \( j = i-m+1, i-m+2, \ldots, i \) and derive the equations expressing the control points of new curve through the control points \( p_j \):

$$
\begin{align*}
q_j &= p_j, & j &= 0, 1, \ldots, i-m, \\
q_j &= \alpha_j p_j + (1-\alpha_j)p_{j-1}, & j &= i-m+1, i-m+2, \ldots, i, \\
q_{j+1} &= p_j, & j &= i+1, i+2, \ldots, n.
\end{align*}
$$

To insert the knot \( v \) (\( t_i \leq v < t_{i+1} \)) into the curve (1.9.1), the control points in the obtained equalities must be multiplied by their weights. The weights of the control points of the new curve are expressed in terms of the weights of the control points of the original curve by similar formulas:

$$
\begin{align*}
w_j &= w_j, & j &= 0, 1, \ldots, i-m, \\
w_j &= \alpha_j w_j + (1-\alpha_j)w_{j-1}, & j &= i-m+1, i-m+2, \ldots, i, \\
w_{j+1} &= w_j, & j &= i+1, i+2, \ldots, n.
\end{align*}
$$

The inserted knot may coincide with a knot existing in the sequence of knots of the B-spline curveâ€”for example, \( v = t_i \). Thus, the new knot can be inserted several times, provided it does not exceed the order of multiplicity of the B-spline curve.

### 1.12. Examples of B-Spline Curves

As an illustration, let us construct B-spline curves on \( n+1 \) control points with knots of integer values. Parameterization with equidistant values of knots is called uniform.

Let the first \( m+1 \) knots of an open B-spline curve have zero values: \( t_0 = t_1 = \ldots = t_m = 0 \); let the next \( n-m \) knots have integer values from 1 to \( n-m \): \( t_{n+1} = i, i=1,2,\ldots,n-m \); and let the remaining \( m+1 \) knots be set to \( n-m+1 \): \( t_{n+1} = t_{n+2} = \ldots = t_{n+m+1} = n-m+1 \). The parameter of the open B-spline curve varies from \( t_m = 0 \) to \( t_{n+1} = n-m+1 \). Fig. 1.12.1 shows a set of cubic B-spline curves constructed on an extended sequence of knots 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6 for nine control points.
A B-spline curve constructed on these points and its control polyline are shown in Fig. 1.12.2. Similar to the Bezier curve, the B-spline curve does not pass through its control points except at its endpoints. The parameter $t$ of the curve shown in Fig. 1.12.2 takes values in the interval $0 \leq t \leq 6$.

Let the knots of a closed periodic B-spline curve be: $t_i = i - m$, $i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n + 2m + 1$. The parameter of the closed B-spline curve takes values from $t_m = 0$ to $t_{n+m+1} = n + 1$. Fig. 1.12.3 shows a set of cubic B-splines constructed on an extended sequence of knots $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ for six control points. For a closed curve, all B-splines are similar to each other.

A closed periodic B-spline curve constructed on these points and its control polyline are shown in Fig. 1.12.4. The parameter of the curve shown in Fig. 1.12.4 takes values in the interval $0 \leq t \leq 6$.
Fig. 1.12.4.

Fig. 1.12.5 shows the B-spline curves of the first, third, fifth, and seventh order constructed on the same eight control points. One can see in Fig. 1.12.5 that the higher order of the curve the smoother it is. The first order B-spline curve coincides with the control polyline.

Fig. 1.12.6 illustrates the influence of control point weight $p_4$ on the shape of the fifth-order curve (the weights of the other control points are equal to 1).

The greater the weight of a vertex, the closer to it the B-spline curve passes. In general, the weight of a vertex may be zero or negative. In practice, B-spline curves of the second and third order are most frequently used.

1.13. B-Spline Curves and Bezier Curves

Let us show that Bezier curves are special cases of B-spline curves. To do this we
modify the B-spline indexing. We assign an index equal to index of the first knot to a B-spline. Similarly, a B-spline curve can be assigned an index equal to the index of the last knot.

We define a B-spline with its index being equal to the last knot in the sequence on which it is constructed. Using this B-spline we will construct B-spline curves and derive De Boor's algorithm for them.

In addition to (1.8.1) we define a B-spline of order m constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of knots $t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_i$ by the equality

$$N^m_i(t) = (t_i - t_{i-m-1})\sigma_m[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_i]. \quad (1.13.1)$$

Alongside (1.8.2) we define the unnormalized B-spline of order m constructed on a non-decreasing sequence of knots $t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_i$ by the equality

$$M^m_i(t) = \sigma_m[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_i]. \quad (1.13.2)$$

We noted earlier that a B-spline may be associated with any knot of the sequence it is constructed on by its subscript index. In formulas (1.13.1) and (1.13.2) B-spline index i points to the last knot of the sequence, and is located after the index m characterizing the B-spline order. From the definitions it follows that $N_{i-m-1}^m(t) = N^m_i(t)$ and $M_{i-m-1}^m(t) = M^m_i(t)$.

With definition (1.13.1) most of the B-spline's properties remain unchanged, because the divided difference does not depend on the way knots on which it is constructed are ordered. There will be some changes in recurrence relations bounded to the non-decreasing sequence of knots $t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_i$ that is used in the B-spline curves.

If we reduce all indexes in (1.8.4) by m+1, we get

$$\sigma_m[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_i] = \frac{t_i - t}{t_i - t_{i-m-1}}\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i-m}, t_{i-m+1}, \ldots, t_i] + \frac{t - t_{i-m-1}}{t_i - t_{i-m-1}}\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_{i-1}].$$

Let us write the last equation using the definition (1.13.2) and obtain the Cox-De Boor formula for unnormalized B-splines associated with the last knot of the sequences they are constructed on:

$$M^m_i(t) = \frac{t_i - t}{t_i - t_{i-m-1}}M^{m-1}_{i-1}(t) + \frac{t - t_{i-m-1}}{t_i - t_{i-m-1}}M^{m-1}_i(t). \quad (1.13.3)$$

Recurrence relation (1.13.3) begins with unnormalized B-splines of order zero:

$$M^0_j(t) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{t_j - t_{j-1}}, & \text{if } t_{j-1} \leq t < t_j, \\ 0, & \text{in other cases} \end{cases} \quad (1.13.4)$$
Using the equality \( N^m_i = (t_i - t_{i-m-1})M^m_i(t) \), we obtain the Cox-De Boor formula for B-splines associated with the last knot of non-decreasing sequences on which they are constructed from (1.13.1):

$$
N^m_i(t) = \frac{t_i - t}{t_i - t_{i-m}} N^{m-1}_i(t) + \frac{t - t_{i-m-1}}{t_{i-1} - t_{i-m-1}} N^{m-1}_{i-1}(t).
$$  

(1.13.5)

A recurrence relation (1.13.5) begins with B-splines of order zero

$$
N^0_j(t) = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } t_{j-1} \leq t < t_j \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}.
$$

(1.13.6)

Using the definition of the divided difference (1.7.2) we obtain

$$
N^m_i = (t_{i-m-1} - t_i) \sigma_m[t_{i-m}, t_{i-m+1}, \ldots, t_i] =
\sigma_m[t_{i-m}, t_{i-m+1}, \ldots, t_i] - \sigma_m[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_{i-1}].
$$

(1.13.7)

We calculate the derivative of the B-spline \( N^m_i(t) \) with the help of (1.13.7):

$$
\frac{dN^m_i(t)}{dt} = \frac{d\sigma_m[t_{i-m}, t_{i-m+1}, \ldots, t_i]}{dt} - \frac{d\sigma_m[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_{i-1}]}{dt}.
$$

Substituting the derivatives of the truncated power function with respect to \( t \)

$$
\frac{d\sigma_m}{dt} = -m(z - t)^{m-1}_+ = -m\sigma_{m-1},
$$

in the last expression we get

$$
\frac{dN^m_i(t)}{dt} = -m\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i-m}, t_{i-m+1}, \ldots, t_i] + m\sigma_{m-1}[t_{i-m-1}, t_{i-m}, \ldots, t_{i-1}] =
-mM^{m-1}_i(t) + mM^{m-1}_{i-1}(t) =
-\frac{m}{t_i - t_{i-m}} N^{m-1}_i(t) + \frac{m}{t_{i-1} - t_{i-m-1}} N^{m-1}_{i-1}(t).
$$

(1.13.8)

Similarly, we obtain the formula for the derivative of the unnormalized B-spline \( M^m_i(t) \)

$$
\frac{dM^m_i(t)}{dt} = m \frac{M^{m-1}_{i-1}(t) - M^{m-1}_i(t)}{t_i - t_{i-m-1}}.
$$

Suppose we are given an infinite (or long enough) non-decreasing sequence of knots \( t_i \), and a B-spline of order \( m \) is constructed on every \( m+2 \) consecutive knots. By
definition (1.13.1), only \( m+1 \) B-splines are nonzero at any \( t_{i-1} < t < t_i \)â€”namely, \( N^m_i(t), N^m_{i+1}(t), \ldots, N^m_{i+m}(t) \)â€”and their sum is equal to 1. It is necessary to use (1.13.7) instead of (1.8.9) in formula (1.8.10) in order to prove this property.

B-splines \( N^m_{i-m}(t) \) and \( N^m_i(t) \) constructed on the same sequence of knots coincide; therefore, the B-spline curve (1.9.1) coincides with the curve

$$
r(t) = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{n} N^m_j(t) w_j p_j}{\sum_{j=0}^{n} N^m_j(t) w_j}
$$  

(1.13.9)

after decreasing indexes for all knots of the curve (1.9.1) by \( m+1 \). Curve (1.13.9) is distinguished from curve (1.9.1) only by recurrence relations used to calculate the radius vector and the derivatives of the curve.

The \( k \)-th derivative of the numerator on the right-hand side of (1.13.9) is

$$
\frac{d^k(w r)}{dt^k} = \frac{d^k}{dt^k} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n} N^m_j w_j p_j \right) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-k} N^{m-k}_j p^{(k)}_j,
$$

(1.13.10)

where \( p^{(k)}_j = (m + 1 - k) \frac{p^{(k-1)}_{j+1} - p^{(k-1)}_j}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}}, \quad k = 1,2,\ldots,m, \quad j = 0,1,\ldots,n-k, \quad p^{(0)}_j = w_j p_j. \)

The \( k \)-th derivative of the denominator on the right-hand side of (1.13.9) is

$$
\frac{d^k w}{dt^k} = \frac{d^k}{dt^k} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{n} N^m_j w_j \right) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-k} N^{m-k}_j w^{(k)}_j,
$$

(1.13.11)

where \( w^{(k)}_j = (m + 1 - k) \frac{w^{(k-1)}_{j+1} - w^{(k-1)}_j}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}}, \quad k = 1,2,\ldots,m, \quad j = 0,1,\ldots,n-k, \quad w^{(0)}_j = w_j. \)

Proofs of (1.13.10) and (1.13.11) are similar to the proofs of (1.9.6) and (1.9.7).

Let us transform the numerator of (1.13.9) using the formula (1.13.5) as follows:

$$
w r(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} N^m_j w_j p_j = \sum_{j=i}^{i+m} N^m_j w_j p_j =
$$

$$
= \sum_{j=i}^{i+m-1} N^{m-1}_j \left( \frac{t_j - t}{t_j - t_{j-m}} w_j p_j + \frac{t - t_{j-m}}{t_j - t_{j-m}} w_{j+1} p_{j+1} \right) = \sum_{j=i}^{i+m-1} N^{m-1}_j r^{(1)}_j =
$$

$$
= \sum_{j=i}^{i+m-2} N^{m-2}_j \left( \frac{t_j - t}{t_j - t_{j-m+1}} r^{(1)}_j + \frac{t - t_{j-m+1}}{t_j - t_{j-m+1}} r^{(1)}_{j+1} \right) =
$$

$$
= \sum_{j=i}^{i+m-2} N^{m-2}_j r^{(2)}_j = \ldots = \sum_{j=i}^{i+m-m} N^0_j(t) r^{(m)}_j = r^{(m)}_i,
$$
where we introduced the notation \( r^{(0)}_j = w_j p_j \), \( r^{(k)}_j = \frac{t_j - t}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} r^{(k-1)}_j + \frac{t - t_{j-m-1+k}}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} r^{(k-1)}_{j+1} \)

for \( k \) in the range from 1 to \( m \). For the denominator of (1.13.9), we obtain a similar expression

$$
w(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{i+m} N^m_j w_j = \sum_{j=1}^{i+m-1} N^{m-1}_j w^{(1)}_j = \sum_{j=1}^{i+m-2} N^{m-2}_j w^{(2)}_j = \ldots = w^{(m)}_i ,
$$

where we introduced the notation \( w^{(0)}_j = w_j \), \( w^{(k)}_j = \frac{t_j - t}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} w^{(k-1)}_j + \frac{t - t_{j-m-1+k}}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} w^{(k-1)}_{j+1} \)

for \( k \) in the range from 1 to \( m \).

We have developed De Boor's algorithm for calculating the radius vector of the point of the B-spline curve (1.13.9) in determining B-splines (1.13.1) for the parameter \( t_{i-1} \leq t < t_i \)

$$
r(t) = \frac{w r(t)}{w(t)} = \frac{r^{(m)}_i}{w^{(m)}_i} ,
$$

where \( r^{(m)}_i \) and \( w^{(m)}_i \) are calculated using recurrence relations

$$
r^{(k)}_j = \frac{t_j - t}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} r^{(k-1)}_j + \frac{t - t_{j-m-1+k}}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} r^{(k-1)}_{j+1} ,
$$

$$
w^{(k)}_j = \frac{t_j - t}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} w^{(k-1)}_j + \frac{t - t_{j-m-1+k}}{t_j - t_{j-m-1+k}} w^{(k-1)}_{j+1} ,
$$

starting with \( r^{(0)}_j = w_j p_j \), \( w^{(0)}_j = w_j \).

The B-spline curves (1.9.1) and (1.13.9) are equivalent and their only difference lies in the choice between the definition of B-splines as in (1.8.1) or as in (1.13.1).

Consider the special case of B-spline curve for which B-splines of \( n \)-th order \( N^n_i(t) \), \( i=0,1,\ldots,n \) are constructed on a sequence of knots \( t_{-1-n}=t_{-n}=\ldots=t_{-1}=0 \), \( t_0=t_1=\ldots=t_n=1 \). Recurrence relation (1.13.3) for such a sequence takes the form

$$
M^n_i(t) = (1-t) M^{n-1}_i(t) + t M^{n-1}_{i-1}(t) .
$$

Since every B-spline is nonzero on the interval \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \), then B-splines are related by

$$
N^n_i(t) = (1-t) N^{n-1}_i(t) + t N^{n-1}_{i-1}(t) ,
$$

which starts with B-spline \( N^0_0(t) = 1 \). Comparing the obtained recurrence relation with (1.4.4), we arrive at the conclusion that \( N^n_i(t) = B^n_i(t) \) on the sequence of knots \( t_{-1-n}=
$t_n = \ldots = t_{i-1} = 0$, $t_0 = t_1 = \ldots = t_n = 1$. The equality of the special case of the B-splines $N^n_i(t)$ and the Bernstein functions $B^n_i(t)$ implies an equality of the special case of the B-spline curve (1.13.9) and the rational Bezier curve (1.6.2). As $N_{i-n-1}^n(t) = N^n_i(t)$ B-splines $N^n_i(t)$ are equal to Bernstein functions $B^n_i(t)$ on the sequence of knots $t_0 = t_1 = \ldots = t_n = 0$, $t_{n+1} = t_{n+2} = \ldots = t_{2n+1} = 1$, and therefore the special case of the B-spline curve (1.9.1) coincides with the rational Bezier curve (1.6.2). Thus, we see that the B-spline curve is a generalization of the Bezier curve.

### 1.14. Special Cases of B-Spline Curves

Construct two first-order B-splines on the sequence of knots $t_0 = t_1 = 0$, $t_2 = t_3 = 1$

$$N_0^1(t) = \frac{t_2 - t}{t_2 - t_1} N_1^0(t) = 1 - t,$$

$$N_1^1(t) = \frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1} N_1^0(t) = t.$$

The B-spline curve (1.9.2) based on these B-splines is a line segment

$$r(t) = N_0^1 p_0 + N_1^1 p_1 = (1 - t)p_0 + tp_1,$$

joining the points $p_0$ and $p_1$.

If we construct the B-spline curve (1.9.2) with $n+1$ vertices on the sequence of knots $t_0 = t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_{n+1} = t_{n+2}$ based on the B-splines of the first order, it will be a polyline. The domain of the parameter of the B-spline curve in this case is $t_1 \leq t \leq t_{n+2}$. B-splines of the first order are defined by equality

$$N_i^1(t) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+1} - t_i}, & \text{if } t_i \leq t < t_{i+1}, \\
\frac{t_{i+2} - t}{t_{i+2} - t_{i+1}}, & \text{if } t_{i+1} \leq t < t_{i+2}, \\
0, & \text{if } t < t_i \text{ or } t \geq t_{i+2}.
\end{cases}$$

We see that $N_i^1(t)$ are piecewise linear functions taking values $N_i^1(t_{i+1}) = 1$ and $N_j^1(t_{i+1}) = 0$, $j \neq i$. Fig. 1.14.1 shows the first-order B-splines for an open polyline constructed on six control points.
A closed polyline can be constructed on the sequence of knots $t_0 = -1$, $t_1 = 0$, $t_2 = 1$, ..., $t_i = i-1$, ..., $t_{n+2} = n+1$, $t_{n+3} = n+2$ as a special case of the B-spline curve (1.9.2). The parameter of the B-spline curve in this case varies within the range $t_1 \leq t \leq t_{n+2}$. The first-order B-splines for periodic closed polylines constructed on four control points are shown in Fig. 1.14.2.

Consider a NURBS representation of the Lagrange spline. Suppose we need to construct the B-spline curve passing through points $a_i$ for parameter values $x_i$, $i=0,1,...,n$. We can construct the B-spline curve of $n$-th order (1.9.2) on the sequence of knots: $t_0 = t_1 = ... = t_n = x_0$, $t_{n+1} = t_{n+2} = ... = t_{2n+1} = x_n$. The sequence contains $2n+2$ knots in total. The B-spline curve contains $n+1$ control points. The weight of each control point is set equal to 1. The control points $p_i$, $i=0,1,...,n$ of the B-spline curve can be found from the system of equations

$$N_0^n(x_0)p_0 + N_1^n(x_0)p_1 + ... + N_n^n(x_0)p_n = a_0$$
$$N_0^n(x_1)p_0 + N_1^n(x_1)p_1 + ... + N_n^n(x_1)p_n = a_1$$
$$...$$
$$N_0^n(x_n)p_0 + N_1^n(x_n)p_1 + ... + N_n^n(x_n)p_n = a_n$$

The determinant of this system of equations is not zero if there are no coincident points among $x_i$. Since B-splines $N_j^n(t)$ are polynomials of degree $n$ on the interval $[x_0,x_n]$, the constructed B-spline curve is a polynomial function of degree $n$, and it
coincides with the Lagrange and Newton splines.

Consider a NURBS representation of an open cubic spline passing through the points \(a_i\) at the parameter values \(x_i, i=0,1,...,n\) and having the derivatives of the radius vector at the endpoints \(q_0\) and \(q_n\). A cubic spline is a piecewise polynomial function of the third degree of the parameter having continuous derivatives up to the second order.

Therefore, we will use B-splines of the third order \(N_j^3(t)\) to construct a B-spline curve coinciding with the cubic spline. To match the start and end points of the spline and the B-spline curve, the four start and the four end knots of the sequence must have a multiplicity equal to four. We can construct the following sequence of knots:

\(t_0 = t_1 = t_2 = t_3 = x_0, \quad t_4 = x_1, \quad t_5 = x_2, ..., \quad t_{n+3} = x_n, \quad t_{n+4} = t_{n+5} = t_{n+6} = x_n.\)

The sequence contains \(n+7\) knots in total. The B-spline curve contains \(n+3\) control points. The weight of each control point is set equal to 1. Thus, the B-spline curve that coincides with the cubic spline will have the form

$$ r(t) = \sum_{j=0}^{n+3} N_j^3(t)p_j. $$

The B-spline curve, as well as the cubic spline, will have a domain \(x_0 \leq t \leq x_n\).

The control points \(p_j, j=0,1,...,n+2\) can be found from the following conditions:

$$ r(x_0) = a_0, \quad \frac{dr}{dt}(x_0) = q_0, $$
$$ r(x_i) = a_i, \quad i = 1,2,...,n, $$
$$ \frac{dr}{dt}(x_n) = q_n, \quad r(x_n) = a_n. $$

These conditions lead to a system of \(n+3\) equations:

$$ N_0^3(x_0)p_0 + N_1^3(x_0)p_1 + ... + N_{n+2}^3(x_0)p_{n+2} = a_0, $$
$$ 3N_1^2(x_0) \frac{p_1 - p_0}{t_5 - t_2} + 3N_2^2(x_0) \frac{p_2 - p_1}{t_6 - t_3} + ... + 3N_{n+2}^2(x_0) \frac{p_{n+2} - p_{n+1}}{t_{n+5} - t_{n+2}} = q_0, $$
$$ N_0^3(x_1)p_0 + N_1^3(x_1)p_1 + ... + N_{n+2}^3(x_1)p_{n+2} = a_1, $$
$$ N_0^3(x_2)p_0 + N_1^3(x_2)p_1 + ... + N_{n+2}^3(x_2)p_{n+2} = a_2, $$
$$ ... $$
$$ N_0^3(x_{n-1})p_0 + N_1^3(x_{n-1})p_1 + ... + N_{n+2}^3(x_{n-1})p_{n+2} = a_{n-1}, $$
$$ 3N_1^2(x_n) \frac{p_1 - p_0}{t_5 - t_2} + 3N_2^2(x_n) \frac{p_2 - p_1}{t_6 - t_3} + ... + 3N_{n+2}^2(x_n) \frac{p_{n+2} - p_{n+1}}{t_{n+5} - t_{n+2}} = q_n, $$
$$ N_0^3(x_n)p_0 + N_1^3(x_n)p_1 + ... + N_{n+2}^3(x_n)p_{n+2} = a_n. $$

Using (1.9.3) and (1.9.4), we define the values of the B-splines at the parametric values \(t=x_i, i=0,1,...,n\). Only one B-spline of the third order \(N_0^3(x_0) = 1\) and one B-
spline of the second order \( N_1^2(x_0) = 1 \) are nonzero for the parameter \( t=x_0 \). For the parameter \( t=x_n \), the B-spline of the third order \( N_{n+2}^3(x_n) = 1 \) and one B-spline of the second order \( N_{n+2}^2(x_n) = 1 \) are nonzero too. For each parameter value \( t=x_{j-3}=t_j \), \( j=4,5,\ldots,n+2 \) only three B-splines of the third order are nonzero:

$$
N_{j-3}^3(t_j) = \frac{t_{j+1}-t_j}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-2}} \cdot \frac{t_{j+1}-t_j}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-1}},
$$

$$
N_{j-2}^3(t_j) = \frac{t_j-t_{j-1}}{t_{j+2}-t_{j-1}} \cdot \frac{t_{j+2}-t_j}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-1}} + \frac{t_{j+1}-t_j}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-2}} \cdot \frac{t_j-t_{j-2}}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-1}},
$$

$$
N_{j-1}^3(t_j) = \frac{t_j-t_{j-1}}{t_{j+2}-t_{j-1}} \cdot \frac{t_j-t_{j-1}}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-1}}
$$

(1.14.1)

and two B-splines of the second order:

$$
N_{j-2}^2(t_j) = \frac{t_{j+1}-t_j}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-1}},
$$

$$
N_{j-1}^2(t_j) = \frac{t_j-t_{j-1}}{t_{j+1}-t_{j-1}}.
$$

(1.14.2)

After substituting (1.14.1) and (1.14.2), the system of equations for determining the control points takes the following form:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

Fig. 1.14.3 shows a third-order B-spline curve coinciding with a cubic spline constructed on six points (\( n=5 \)).
Fig. 1.14.4 shows a set of B-splines of the third-order B-spline curve shown in Fig. 1.14.3 coinciding with the cubic spline.

For a closed periodic cubic spline, the control points \( p_j, j=0,1,...,n \) can be found from the conditions: \( r(x_i) = a_i, i=0,1,...,n \). The number of the control points of a B-spline curve is equal to the number of given points of the spline.

Consider a NURBS representation of an open composite Hermite spline of the third order (1.3.10) with parametric values \( x_i \) passing through points \( a_i \) and having the derivatives \( q_i \) at these points, where \( i=0,1,2,...,n \) are point numbers. A Hermite spline is a composite curve of the third degree with discontinuous second- and third-order derivatives at the points \( x_i \). Therefore, we will use B-splines of the third order \( N^3_i(t) \) with multiple knots to construct a B-spline curve. In order to match the start and end points of the spline and the B-spline curve, the four start and four end knots of the sequence must have a multiplicity of four, and the rest of the knots of the sequence must have a multiplicity of two. Let us construct the following sequence of knots:

\( t_0=t_1=t_2=t_3=x_0, \quad t_4=t_5=x_1, \quad t_6=t_7=x_2, \quad t_8=t_9=x_3,..., \quad t_{2i+2}=t_{2i+3}=x_i,..., \quad t_{2n}=t_{2n+1}=x_{n-1}, \quad t_{2n+2}=t_{2n+3}=t_{2n+4}=t_{2n+5}=x_n \).

The sequence has \( 2(n+1)+4 \) knots in total. The B-spline curve will contain \( 2n+2 \) control points. The weight of each control point is set equal to 1. Thus, a B-spline curve coinciding with the Hermite spline has the following form:
The B-spline curve, as well as the Hermite spline, will have a domain \( x_0 \leq t \leq x_n \).

The start and end control points of the B-spline curve are equal to the start and end control points of the spline, respectively: \( p_0 = a_0, \ p_{2n+1} = a_n \). The control points of the B-spline curve adjacent to them are constructed as follows:

$$
p_1 = a_0 + \frac{x_1 - x_0}{3} q_0, \quad p_{2n} = a_n - \frac{x_n - x_{n-1}}{3} q_n.
$$

Next we construct a pair of control points of the B-spline curve on the basis of each "internal" control point \( a_i, i=1,2,...,n-1 \) of the Hermite spline as follows:

$$
p_{2i} = a_i - \frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{3} q_i, \quad p_{2i+1} = a_i + \frac{x_{i+1} - x_i}{3} q_i. \tag{1.14.3}
$$

Using (1.9.3) and (1.9.4), we define the values of the B-splines at the parametric values \( t=x_i, i=0,1,...,n \). Only one B-spline of the third order \( N_0^3(x_0)=1 \) and one B-spline of the second order \( N_1^2(x_0)=1 \) are nonzero for the parameter \( t=x_0 \). For the parameter \( t=x_n \) also only one third-order B-spline \( N_{2n+1}^3(x_n)=1 \) and one second-order B-spline \( N_{2n+1}^2(x_n)=1 \) are nonzero. From (1.14.1) it follows that for each parameter value \( t=t_j=t_{j-1}, j=5,6,...,2n+1 \) only two third-order B-splines are nonzero:

$$
N_{j-3}^3(t_j) = \frac{t_{j+1} - t_j}{t_{j+1} - t_{j-2}} \cdot \frac{t_{j+1} - t_j}{t_{j+1} - t_{j-1}}, \quad N_{j-2}^3(t_j) = \frac{t_{j+1} - t_j}{t_{j+1} - t_{j-2}} \cdot \frac{t_j - t_{j-2}}{t_{j+1} - t_{j-1}}.
$$

Or after substitution \( t_{2i+2}=t_{2i+3}=x_i, i=1,2,...,n-1 \):

$$
N_{2i}^3(x_i) = \frac{x_{i+1} - x_i}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}}, \quad N_{2i+1}^3(x_i) = \frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}}.
$$

From (1.14.2) it follows that for each parameter value \( t=t_j=t_{j-1}, j=5,6,...,2n+1 \), only one second-order B-spline is nonzero:

$$
N_{j-2}^2(t_j) = \frac{t_{j+1} - t_j}{t_{j+1} - t_{j-1}}.
$$

Or after substitution \( t_{2i+2}=t_{2i+3}=x_i, i=1,2,...,n-1 \): \( N_{2i+1}^2(x_i)=1 \). Let us verify that at parameter values \( t=x_i, i=0,1,...,n \), the B-spline curve has radius vector \( a_i \) and derivatives \( q_i \) by direct substitution. Indeed,
$$ r(x_0) = N_0^3(x_0)p_0 = a_0, $$
$$ r(x_i) = N_{2i}^3(x_i)p_{2i} + N_{2i+1}^3(x_i)p_{2i+1} = a_i, $$
$$ r(x_n) = N_{2n+1}^3(x_n)p_{2n+1} = a_n, $$

and according to (1.9.5) and (1.14.3),

$$ \frac{dr}{dt}(x_0) = 3N_1^2(x_0)\frac{p_1 - p_0}{t_4 - t_1} = q_0, $$
$$ \frac{dr}{dt}(x_i) = 3N_{2i+1}^2(x_i)\frac{p_{2i+1} - p_{2i}}{t_{2i+4} - t_{2i+1}} = q_i, $$
$$ \frac{dr}{dt}(x_n) = 3N_{2n+1}^2(x_n)\frac{p_{2n+1} - p_{2n}}{t_{2n+4} - t_{2n+1}} = q_n. $$

Fig. 1.14.5 shows the third-order B-curve coinciding with the composite Hermite spline constructed on four points \((n=3)\).

![Fig. 1.14.5](image)

Fig. 1.14.6 shows a set of B-splines of the third-order B-spline curve coinciding with a composite Hermite spline also shown in Fig. 1.14.5.

For the periodic closed Hermite spline, the sequence of knots of the B-spline curve contains only knots of multiplicity two. The control points can be found by formulas (1.14.3). The number of control points of the B-spline curve is equal to double the number of the given points of the spline.

![Fig. 1.14.6](image)
Consider a NURBS representation of a second-order curve. We showed that curves of the second order can be represented as rational Bezier curves. A B-spline curve is a generalization of a rational Bezier curve. Therefore some part of any second-order curve can be represented as a quadratic B-spline curve constructed on three points, on the basis of the sequence of knots $t_0 = t_1 = t_2 < t_3 = t_4 = t_5$.

A periodic closed curve of the second order can be completely represented in the form of a B-spline curve having multiple knots. Fig. 1.14.7 shows an elliptical B-spline curve of the second order and its control polyline.

![Fig. 1.14.7](image)

It was constructed on the points $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7$. Its control polyline is a rectangle circumscribed about the elliptical curve. The weights of the control points are: $w_0 = w_2 = w_4 = w_6 = 1$, $w_1 = w_3 = w_5 = w_7 = \cos(\pi/4)$. The sequence of knots has the form $t_0 = -1$, $t_1 = t_2 = 0$, $t_3 = t_4 = 1$, $t_5 = t_6 = 2$, $t_7 = t_8 = 3$, $t_9 = t_{10} = 4$, $t_{11} = t_{12} = 5$. If we want the length of a parametric curve shown in Fig. 1.14.7 to be equal to $2\pi$, then instead of the sequence of the knots mentioned above we can use the sequence: $t_0 = -\pi/2$, $t_1 = t_2 = 0$, $t_3 = t_4 = \pi/2$, $t_5 = t_6 = \pi$, $t_7 = t_8 = 3\pi/2$, $t_9 = t_{10} = 2\pi$, $t_{11} = t_{12} = 2\pi + \pi/2$. The B-spline curve can have breakpoints with multiple knots.

Fig. 1.14.8 shows a set of B-splines of the quadratic B-spline curve coinciding with the ellipse also shown in Fig. 1.14.7.

### 1.15. Curves Constructed on Other Curves

Curves may be constructed on the basis of other curves. We consider the extended, trimmed, equidistant, remade, reference, and bridge curves. A curve which is
the basis for construction of a new curve is called its base curve. A curve of the same type as the constructed curve should not be used as the base curve.

An extended curve may be constructed on the basis of any curve by changing the domain of the curve parameter. Suppose it is required to extend the curve \( r_b(t) \), \( t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}} \) by expanding the domain of the parameters to \( a + t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}} + b \). When \( a < 0 \) and \( b > 0 \), the curve is extended beyond its limits; when \( a > 0 \) and \( b < 0 \) the curve is trimmed.

If the curve is not periodic and its parameter goes beyond the limits of the domain, the curve may be continued in accordance with the rule for calculation of the radius vector of the curve. Such curves include analytic curves and curves based on the curves with the known rule of the radius vector calculation. For example, the radius vector of the cylindrical helix continues to change according to the rule for a cylindrical helix outside the domain.

In general, in the absence of calculation rule for the non-periodic curve outside its domain, we continue the curve along the tangent it has at the corresponding endpoint. The radius vector of the extended curve is calculated by the formula

$$
r(t) = \begin{cases} 
r_b(t_{\text{min}}) + (t - t_{\text{min}}) \frac{dr_b}{dt} \bigg|_{t_{\text{min}}} & \text{if } t < t_{\text{min}}, \\
r_b(t), & \text{if } t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}}, \\
r_b(t_{\text{max}}) + (t - t_{\text{max}}) \frac{dr_b}{dt} \bigg|_{t_{\text{max}}} & \text{if } t_{\text{max}} > t.
\end{cases}
$$  

(1.15.1)

If the base curve is periodic, we can perform a cyclic recalculation of the parameter when it is out of the domain. In this case, the radius vector of the extended curve is calculated using the formula

$$
r(t) = r_b(t - p \cdot \Phi((t - t_{\text{min}})/p)),
$$

(1.15.2)

where \( p \) is the period of basic curve and \( \Phi(w) \) is a function to calculate the maximum integer less than \( w \).

An extended curve should not be used as the base curve for another extended curve. One should use the base curve of the initial extended curve as a base curve, with corresponding recalculation of the parameters \( a \) and \( b \).

The radius vectorâ€”not only extended curve, but of any curve with its parameter out of the domainâ€”can be computed using (1.15.1) or (1.15.2).

A trimmed curve is some part of any curve with the opposite or the same direction. Let the parameter \( t \) of the base curve vary in the range \( t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}} \). We define a trimmed curve as the part of the base curve starting at parameter \( t_1 \) and ending at parameter \( t_2 \). The direction of the trimmed curve may coincide with the direction of the base curve, or be oppositeâ€”for example, if \( t_2 < t_1 \). If the curve is periodic and closed, there are two ways to progress from point \( t_1 \) to point \( t_2 \): in the positive direction of the base curve and in the opposite direction. To overcome this ambiguity, one
introduces a sign parameter that takes values of +1 or -1 and describes the coincidence of directions of the closed curve and the base curve. The parameter of the trimmed curve \( w_{\text{min}} = 0 \) corresponds to the parameter of the base curve \( t_1 \), while the parameter of the trimmed curve \( w_{\text{max}} = s \) corresponds to the parameter of the base curve \( t_2 \), where \( s \) is the parametric distance between \( t_2 \) and \( t_1 \) (provided that the curve is closed). If the curve is open, then \( s = |t_2 - t_1| \). The radius vector of the trimmed curve is described by

$$
r(w) = r_b(t + w \cdot \text{sign}), \quad 0 \leq w \leq s,
$$

(1.15.3)

where \( r_b(t) \) is the base curve.

A trimmed curve should not be used as the base curve for another trimmed curve. One should use the base curve of the initial trimmed curve as a base curve, with appropriate recalculation of the trimming parameters.

A trimmed curve may be used to change the direction of the curve. In this case \( t_1 = t_{\text{max}}, t_2 = t_{\text{min}}, \) and \( \text{sign} = -1 \).

A trimmed curve may be used to change the position of the starting point of the periodic closed curve. For this purpose, the base curve must be periodic and closed, and \( t_1 = t_2 \). In this case the trimmed curve will also be periodic and closed.

A remade curve may be constructed on the basis of any curve by changing the values of its extreme parameters. Suppose it is required that the curve \( r_b(t), t_{\text{min}} \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}} \) has the domain of the parameter \( w_{\text{min}} \leq w \leq w_{\text{max}} \). Let us construct the remade curve for this case

$$
r(w) = r_b(t(w)), \quad w_{\text{min}} \leq w \leq w_{\text{max}},
$$

(1.15.4)

where \( t(w) = t_{\text{min}} + \frac{w_{\text{max}} - w}{w_{\text{max}} - w_{\text{min}}} \cdot t_{\text{max}} - \frac{w - w_{\text{min}}}{w_{\text{max}} - w_{\text{min}}} \cdot t_{\text{max}} \).

A remade curve should not be used as the base curve for another remade curve. Instead, one should use the base curve of the initial remade curve for this purpose.

A remade curve coincides with the base curve, but has a different parameter domain. A curve with a modified parameter length is used to align the parameter domains of the two curves.

An offset curve is described by the vector function

$$
r(t) = r_b(t) + a \times t_b(t),
$$

(1.15.5)

where \( r_b(t) \) is the basis curve, \( t_b(t) = \frac{r_b}{\sqrt{r_b \cdot r_b}} \) is the unit vector tangent to the base curve at a given point, and \( a \) is a given vector. The parameter domain of the offset curve may coincide with the parameter domain of the base curve, and may be extended according to the rules of the extended curve construction.

The offset curve justifies its name if \( r_b(t) \) is a planar curve and vector \( a \) is orthogonal to the plane of the base curve. In this case the second term on the right-hand
side of (1.15.5) is a vector that lies in the plane of the base curve, orthogonal to it, and of length \( a \). As a result, we get a curve every point of which is separated from the corresponding point of the base curve by the length of vector \( a \) along the normal. Fig. 1.15.1 shows an example of the offset curve.

$$
\frac{a}{r_b(t)} r(t)
$$

Fig. 1.15.1.

The offset curve should not be used as the base curve for another offset curve. Instead, one should use the base curve of the initial offset curve for this purpose, with appropriate recalculation of the offset vector. For example, if you want to build an offset curve based on the offset curve \( r'(t) = r_b(t) + a' \times t_b(t) \), then as the base curve you should take the curve \( r_b(t) \), and the offset vector must be equal to \( a + a' \).

The reference curve is a curve every point of which is obtained by a transformation of the corresponding point of the base curve. The parameter domain of the reference curve coincides with the parameter domain of the base curve. The radius vector of the reference curve is described by

$$
r(t) = M \cdot r_b(t),
$$

(1.15.6)

where \( r_b(t) \) is the basis curve and \( M \) is the extended transformation matrix.

An extended matrix contains the matrix of transformation and a translation along the vector. In the general case, a transformation of the radius vector of the point \( r_0 \) has the following form:

$$
r = A \cdot r_0 + t,
$$

where \( A \) is a transformation matrix (rotation, symmetry transformation, scaling) and \( t \) a translation vector. Extended matrix \( M \) is the matrix \( A \) padded with zeros at the bottom and with components of the translation vector \( t \) on the right side. It has the form

$$
M = \begin{bmatrix} A & t \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

(1.15.7)

Let us construct the extended matrix of transformation of a curve from the local coordinate system to the global coordinate system as an example. Let the curve \( r_b(t) \) be described in the local Cartesian coordinate system. Suppose we need to work with it in the global Cartesian coordinate system. Let the origin of the local coordinate system be located at point \( p \) with global coordinates \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \), and let basis vectors \( i_x = [x_1 x_2 x_3]^T \),
of the local system be described in the global system by the coordinates \( x_1, x_2, x_3, y_1, y_2, y_3, z_1, z_2, z_3 \), respectively. Then the extended transformation matrix has the form

$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & y_1 & z_1 & p_1 \\
x_2 & y_2 & z_2 & p_2 \\
x_3 & y_3 & z_3 & p_3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

When working with an extended matrix, it is assumed that the radius vectors with coordinates \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are described by the column matrix

$$
r = \begin{bmatrix}
r_1 \\
r_2 \\
r_3 \\
1
\end{bmatrix},
$$

and free vectors with components \( v_1, v_2, v_3 \) are described by means of column-matrix

$$
v = \begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2 \\
v_3 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

A reference curve should not be used as the base curve for another reference curve. Instead, one should use the base curve of the initial reference curve for this purpose, with appropriate recalculation of the transformation matrix. For example, if it is required to construct a reference curve based on the reference curve \( r(t) = M^t r_b(t) \), one should use the curve \( r_b(t) \), and a transformation matrix would be a product of matrices \( M \cdot M' \).

A bridge curve smoothly connects the endpoints of two curves. For example, suppose we need to smoothly conjugate the end of curve \( a(t) \) with the beginning of curve \( b(t) \). The radius vector of the bridge curve is described by

$$
r(w) = a(t_{\text{max}})(1 - 3w^2 + 2w^3) + b(t_{\text{min}})(3w^2 - 2w^3) +
a'(t_{\text{max}})(w - 2w^2 + w^3)k_a + b'(t_{\text{min}})(-w^2 + w^3)k_b,
$$

where \( w \in [0,1] \),

where \( a'(t_{\text{max}}) = \frac{da(t)}{dt} \bigg|_{t=t_{\text{max}}} \) is the derivative of the radius vector of the first conjugated
curve, and \( b'(t_{\text{min}}) = \frac{db(t)}{dt} \bigg|_{t=t_{\text{min}}} \) is the derivative of the radius vector of the second conjugated curve, with \( k_a \) and \( k_b \) as normalization coefficients for derivatives \( a'(t_{\text{max}}) \) and \( b'(t_{\text{min}}) \), respectively. Coefficients \( k_a \) and \( k_b \) are calculated by division of the distance between the conjugating points of the curves by the length of the derivatives \( a'(t_{\text{max}}) \) and \( b'(t_{\text{min}}) \).

1.16. Contours

A composite curve is based on other curves and is the most general form of a curve. The curves forming a composite curve are called segments. To construct a composite curve, the following conditions must be satisfied: The beginning of each subsequent segment must coincide with the end of the previous segment. Closed composite curves are called contours. In a contour, the beginning of the first segment should coincide with the end of the last segment. If the segments of a composite curve are not smoothly joined, the composite curve has breakpoints. In general, the derivatives of the composite curve at the points of conjugation are non-continuous in length and direction. A composite curve is shown in Fig. 1.16.1.

Let the composite curve consist of \( n \) segments

$$ r_i(w_i), \quad w_{\text{min}} \leq w \leq w_{\text{max}}, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n. $$

The initial value of parameter \( t \) of the composite curve is set equal to zero. The parametric length of the composite curve is assumed to be equal to the sum of the parametric lengths of constituent segments \( t_{\text{min}} = 0, \quad t_{\text{max}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_{i_{\text{max}}} - w_{i_{\text{min}}}). \)

![Fig. 1.16.1.](image)

When calculating the radius vector of a composite curve, it is first necessary to define the segment to which the value of the parameter of the composite curve corresponds. Next, we need to determine the corresponding value of the parameter of this segment; and, finally, we calculate the radius vector of the segment, which is the radius vector of the composite curve. Let \( k \) be the number of the segment for parameter \( t \) of the
composite curve. Suppose the following relation holds for this \( k \)

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (w_{i\text{max}} - w_{i\text{min}}) \leq t < \sum_{i=1}^{k} (w_{i\text{max}} - w_{i\text{min}}).
$$

Then, in accordance with what was said before, the radius vector of the composite curve is defined by the equality

$$
r(t) = r_k \left( w_{k\text{min}} + t - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (w_{i\text{max}} - w_{i\text{min}}) \right) = r_k(w_k), \quad 0 \leq t \leq t_{\text{max}},
$$  

(1.16.1)

where the parameter of the \( k \)-th segment is equal to

$$
w_k = w_{k\text{min}} + t - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (w_{i\text{max}} - w_{i\text{min}}).
$$  

(1.16.2)

Conspicuously, the approach for calculation of the radius vector of a composite curve is similar to that for calculating the radius vector of a polyline and a Hermite spline.

Composite curves should not be used as segments of other composite curves; but that does not mean one cannot construct a composite curve from a set of composite curves. If we need to construct a composite curve based on other composite curves, the latter should not be considered as single curves but as sets of curves that make them up.
